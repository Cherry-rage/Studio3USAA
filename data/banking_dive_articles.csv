Revolut valued at $75B,"Revolut is valued at $75 billion after completing a share sale, theBritish fintech said Monday. Revolut did not disclose how many shares were sold or the amount raised. It’s the fifth share sale Revolut has allowed its staff to date, with the fintech asserting it’s “one of the most liquid employee share programmes across private companies in the industry.” The new valuation marks significant growth sinceRevolut’s $45 billion valuation 15 months ago, which came directly after it received its long-awaitedBritish banking license. Since then, Revolut has entered multiple markets,named a chairof its Western Europe arm and finalized itsbanking license in Mexico. It’s also exploring U.S. growth, with Revolut U.S. CEO Sid Jajodia saying in October thatnabbing a stateside charteris part of the firm’s growth “mission.” “The level of investor interest and our new valuation reflect the strength of our business model, which is delivering both rapid growth and strong profitability,” CFO Victor Stinga said in a prepared statement on the recent share sale. “We welcome onboard a series of world-class investors and look forward to working with them for the next stage in Revolut’s evolution.” The transaction was led by Coatue, Greenoaks, Dragoneer and Fidelity Management & Research Company. Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Andreessen Horowitz, Franklin Templeton and T. Rowe Price Associates also participated. In ablog postMonday, Coatue wrote that it sees Revolut “charting a new path.” “They are building the world’s first global financial super-app, which is now operating in 39 countries and serves over 65 million users,” wrote Brendan O’Boyle, Rohan Bharvani and Lucas Swisher, investors at Coatue, which also led Revolut’s 2024 funding round. “What began as a travel card designed to avoid high [foreign exchange] fees has evolved into a multi-product financial platform that is redefining what modern banking looks like for consumers and businesses.” Revolut’s 2024 revenue grew 72% to $4 billion year over year, with profit before tax more than doubling to $1.4 billion. Its Revolut Business arm hit $1 billion in annualized revenue in 2025, the company said. The new valuation “reflects the remarkable progress we have made in the last twelve months towards our vision of building the first truly global bank, serving 100 million customers across 100 countries,” CEO Nik Storonsky said in a prepared statement. A spokesperson for Revolut had no further comment beyond the press release.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/revolut-valued-75-billion/806502/,,
"Comerica, Fifth Third sued by activist investor","Just days after threatening legal action against Comerica, HoldCo Asset Management has sued the regional bank and its proposed buyer, Fifth Third. The activist investor accused Comerica CEO Curt Farmer of being “focused solely on advancing his own interests” based on the “rushed” way the Dallas-based bank’s proposed$10.9 billion acquisition by Fifth Thirdcame together. Theclass-action complaint, filed Friday in the Delaware Court of Chancery by HoldCo Opportunities Fund, alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by Comerica and its board members related to the transaction and its “draconian” provisions. It also accuses the bank of leaving out material information from disclosures related to the deal. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCo also accused Fifth Third of “aiding-and-abetting” the board in breaching its fiduciary duty. HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July, accusing the lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” In October, Fifth Third announced it would acquire Comerica. HoldCoissued a presentationlast week that picked apart the proposed deal, threatening to take Comerica to court if it didn’t release more information on how the agreement came together. Comerica rebuffed at leastone earlier suitor, Financial Institution A, according to a disclosure. That was Regions Bank, American Banker reported. The deal between Comerica and Fifth Third was “negotiated over an extraordinarily compressed timeline,” HoldCo’s Friday complaint contends. It was driven by Farmer’s “fear of an activist contest” led by HoldCo, “and his fear that no other bidder would keep him on,” the firm alleged. “Fearing for his job, Farmer raced to find a friendly white knight that could provide him with a lucrative post-closing role,” the complaint asserts. Farmer isset to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks. Part of the rush, HoldCo claims, was to avoid any proxy contest at Comerica’s annual meeting, to have been held by May 2026. The Fifth Third deal is projected to close in the first quarter of 2026. Although Comerica received an offer from Financial Institution A, the complaint alleges the Dallas bank decided to “nip those negotiations in the bud” and solely focus on Fifth Third. The deal came together hastily and in a way that ensures “no topping bid could disrupt Farmer’s entrenchment plan,” HoldCo attorneys alleged. The merger agreement carries a “gargantuan” termination fee of $500 million and “an absurdly narrow fiduciary-out” that doesn’t let the board scrap the merger for a higher bid, HoldCo said in the complaint. The “draconian” deal protections mean Comerica’s board couldn’t terminate the acquisition for a better proposal until October 2026, even if shareholders don’t vote in favor of the deal, the filing said. HoldCo also alleges the registration statement is “materially misleading and incomplete” and doesn’t provide shareholders with any details that would allow them to compare the deal’s terms with Financial Institution A’s proposed offers. “There is no evidence from the Registration Statement that Comerica ever made a counterproposal or tried to negotiate for a price above the lowest end of the exchange ratio range in Fifth Third’s initial proposal,” the complaint said. “Nor is there any evidence that Comerica made any attempt to re-engage Financial Institution A (to see if it would provide a better proposal) or solicit interest from other potential bidders.” The 17-day span – from the start of potential merger conversations between Farmer and Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence to when an agreement was signed – “is the shortest timeframe of any of the ten largest bank mergers, with the next shortest taking 43 days and the median taking 67 days,” HoldCo contended. “Such negotiations are more reminiscent of distressed bank sales during the 2008 global financial crisis,” the complaint said. In aresponse filed Monday, attorneys for Comerica argued HoldCo’s views are at odds with those of other bank shareholders, and blasted the activist for “asking this Court to deprive stockholders of a merger after agitating for just such a deal.” Fifth Third’s attorneys, in aseparate Monday filing, called HoldCo’s aiding and abetting assertion a “facially meritless claim.” “This case is only about HoldCo’s self-serving activism goals,” Fifth Third’s attorneys said. Comerica and Fifth Third attorneys accused HoldCo of “gamesmanship” and called its claims weak. Comerica’s lawyers also needled HoldCo for “revel[ing] in its notoriety” after pushing for the bank to sell itself and seeking credit for the outcome. Comerica’s attorneys also noted HoldCo was in communication with the bank’s counsel in the days leading up to filing Friday’s complaint. “At no time during those communications did HoldCo indicate it would be filing a suit to enjoin the deal on Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week,” Comerica’s attorneys said. The shareholder vote on the acquisition is tentatively scheduled for Jan. 6. A hearing was set to be held Tuesday related to a motion to expedite the case. Spokespeople for Comerica and Fifth Third declined to comment. Attorneys withBernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman, the law firm representing HoldCo, didn’t return requests for comment. HoldCo also didn’t respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-sued-activist-investor-holdco/806428/,,
Fulton Financial to buy NJ’s Blue Foundry in $243M deal,"Fulton Financial Corp.will acquire Blue Foundry Bancorpin an all-stock transaction valued at $243 million, the companies announced Monday. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, pushes Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based Fulton into northern New Jersey. The bank gained a presence in the southern part of the state last year with itsacquisition of Republic First. The Philadelphia-based bank had locations in New Jersey and New York before it failed. Acquiring $2.15 billion-asset Blue Foundry, headquartered in Rutherford, New Jersey, gives $32 billion-asset Fulton 21 additional branches in eight counties, including four of the state’s most populous. “The expansion in northern New Jersey aligns with our strategy of growing in our local markets and positions us well to drive organic growth across our commercial, consumer, wealth advisory and mortgage businesses,” Fulton CEO Curtis Myers said in a prepared statement. “The combination of our companies creates an opportunity to leverage Fulton’s robust banking services and provide greater convenience and innovative solutions to an expanded customer base, with a continued focus on supporting our local communities,” he said. Under the terms of the agreement, Blue Foundry investors will receive 0.65 shares of Fulton common stock for each share they own. The transaction’s estimated $243 million value stems from Fulton’s $17.96 share price from Friday. “Joining forces with Fulton is an exciting step forward for our employees, customers and communities,” Blue Foundry CEO James Nesci said in a prepared statement. “This partnership allows us to preserve the local relationships and personalized service our customers value, while gaining access to greater resources and providing more solutions and convenience to customers.” In recent years, Blue Foundry has been a publicly traded bank, during which time it has reported more than $20 million in losses,American Bankerreported. Activist investor Larry Seidman, who had pushed for its sale via proxy campaign last year, told American Banker there was “no question whatsoever” that Fulton would be able to produce better results than Blue Foundry has with its assets. “It's a good bank with good management,” Seidman said of Fulton. “Blue Foundry was horrible. They couldn't make any money.” The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to tangible book value per share. It’s expected to be accretive to first full-year earnings by over 5%, and neutral to regulatory capital ratios at close. As part of the deal, Fulton will make a $1.5 million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation, which provides impact grants to nonprofit community organizations in New Jersey.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fulton-financial-to-buy-nj-blue-foundry-243m-deal/806443/,,
MoneyLion to pay $1.75M to settle CFPB lawsuit,"MoneyLion agreed Friday topay $1.75 millionto settle a long-running lawsuit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, alleging the fintech charged more than the maximum 36% interest rate allowed by the Military Lending Act on loans to service members. The settlement narrows – to 12 – the number of cases the CFPB has in active litigation, based on acount given last weekby a representative of the bureau’s workers union. The CFPB has dismissed 22 enforcement actions this year. The case also bolsters the CFPB’s commitment –from April, and subsequently reinforced in a “humility pledge” Friday – to focus on providing redress to service members, veterans and their families. As part of the settlement, MoneyLion is barred from extending consumer credit at rates higher than 36% to borrowers for whom the MLA cap applies. That includes credit insurance premiums or fees, any fee for a debt cancellation contract or debt suspension agreement, or any fee for a credit-related ancillary product sold as part of a credit transaction. It also includes finance charges, application fees or membership fees. That was a focal point of the CFPB’sSeptember 2022 lawsuitagainst the company. MoneyLion required customers to join a membership program – which carried a monthly fee between $19.99 and $29 – to access the fintech’s low annual percentage rate installment loan product, the bureau said when the suit was first filed. But the company failed to allow borrowers to cancel their memberships until their loans were paid, and in some cases, wouldn’t cancel memberships if the borrower had unpaid membership fees, the CFPB added. Friday’s settlement bars MoneyLion from preventing borrowers from canceling their membership. It also does not permit the fintech to engage in collections activities for past unpaid membership fees, collecting membership fees for periods when memberships were suspended. MoneyLion also can’t prevent borrowers from paying off loans in full by using funds in their credit reserve account, according to the settlement. Nor can the company ding borrowers’ credit scores over unpaid membership fees. Also as part of the settlement, MoneyLion must submit an accurate written compliance report, sworn under penalty of perjury, to the CFPB, detailing the number of borrowers who received redress and the amount paid to each. The settlement covers borrowers who had outstanding MoneyLion loans between December 2017 and October 2024. MoneyLion, in September 2022, disputed the CFPB’s allegations, accusing the regulator of taking a “sensationalist route of prioritizing headlines instead of engaging in constructive dialogue.” “MoneyLion has the highest regard for its military and veteran customers and [is] committed to working with this important community to help them achieve better financial health,” the company said at the time. “MoneyLion is honored to serve this important segment of its customer base and is grateful for the sacrifice these men and women have made for our country.” The membership offering represents a small subset of MoneyLion’s business, the company said at the time. Since then, the fintech has come under new management: MoneyLionwas acquired this yearby Gen Digital forabout $1 billion. The CFPB is also not the only entity with a consumer-protection case against MoneyLion.New York’s attorney generalsued MoneyLion and fellow earned wage access provider DailyPay in April, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to tens of thousands of workers with fees that “amount to outrageous annual interest rates in the triple digits.” Thecity of Baltimorelast month sued MoneyLion, alleging the company misled and manipulated consumers into taking out small-dollar, short-term loans that come with high fees. MoneyLion in 2023 persuaded the judge in the CFPB case topause proceedingsahead of aSupreme Court rulingthat affirmed the bureau’s funding structure is constitutional.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-moneylion-settlement-mla-interest-rate-36-cap-military-membership-fees/806439/,,
U.S. Bank hires up for greater Southeast growth,"After adding bankers to serve businesses in Dallas and Houston, U.S. Bank is now focused on further expansion across the Southeast, a business banking executive said. Within the next six months, U.S. Bank plans to hire at least a dozen bankers in a couple of Southeast states where it doesn’t have branches, said Dee O’Dell, head of business banking sales at the Minneapolis-based lender. He didn’t elaborate, butthat group includesAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. The super-regional bank has recently added teams of bankers in markets where it’s seeing greater growth opportunity, including a second team in Charlotte, North Carolina; a second in Las Vegas; and a fourth in Chicago, O’Dell said during a recent interview. In his unit, about 250 people have been hired into new roles this year. In Houston, where the $695 billion-asset bank announced last week it added a business banking team, four people have been hired and the lender plans to bring on two more, he said. In U.S. Bank’s business banking segment, which serves companies generating between $2.5 million to $50 million in annual revenue, about 1,200 employees across the country serve about 75,000 clients, O’Dell said. The consumer and business banking segmentmakes up about 32%of the lender’s overall revenue, which was $21.3 billion year to date,as of Sept. 30. U.S. Bank provides those commercial clients with different types of credit for their capital needs, including conventional financing, owner-occupied real estate loans and Small Business Administration loans. Clients in that size range often “not only have their primary business, but they're looking for ways to diversify,” O’Dell said. “They not only want to own the building they're in, they may want to own some other buildings as well, and so we've got the ability to provide capital for them, not only for their core business, but for investment real estate.” Bankers also seek to connect clients with other U.S. Bank services, such as credit cards, merchant processing, treasury management, foreign exchange and wealth management. Amid a highly competitive landscape, the lender has sharpened efforts to offer anddeliver services to clientsin a comprehensive way, O’Dell said. “Our approach has been to integrate all that together so that there is value that comes from having all of that in one place,” he said. To zero in on where businesses could gain the most benefit, the bank developed – along with a fintech O’Dell wouldn’t name – a proprietary diagnostic tool for companies. The questionnaire assesses business needs and money movement, diagnoses the level of efficiency in those functions and has a team review results with business clients. “The idea is that instead of trying to sell any one of those products, we're approaching it in a much more consultative and holistic way,” O’Dell said. “It helps our clients see how they can be even more efficient, save time in their day, eliminate risk of fraud, other things like that.” That diagnostic effort has bolstered the bank’s success rate in serving new clients since it was introduced nearly two years ago, O’Dell said. “Sometimes our bankers will meet with a company that we don't bank with today. And if your question is, ‘Do you need any banking services?’ The answer might be, ‘No, no, everything's fine. It's all good,’” O’Dell said. “If we can get them to engage with us and have this conversation and fill out this basic template questionnaire, we can go back and provide insights. And often, it opens up a conversation where companies don't even realize the things that they are doing or not doing that could lead to so much greater efficiency.” Another newer internal tool aggregates data to give bankers a view of companies or prospects within the markets they serve, allowing them to sort by sales size, industry type or ownership of property, so they can better target clients based on potential needs, O’Dell said. SBA loans may be a prime option for some of those businesses and that’s an area of lending U.S. Bank seeks to grow further, since it can serve as a company’s entry point into the bank. U.S. Bank has doubled its SBA lending in the past two years, O’Dell said. In fiscal 2025, the bank totaled $871.2 million in SBA 7(a) loans, up 23% from the previous fiscal year,it said last month. “We've been able to use that program to help a number of companies, individuals get capital they wouldn't otherwise be able to get, and because of the way that we approach that, and our client selection in that, the loss ratio that we've had in that space has been very attractive to our shareholders,” O’Dell said. SBA lending can be ideal in some succession situations, O’Dell noted. The segment of businesses O’Dell oversees has a significant number of owners nearing the end of their careers, so the bank also aims to jump on the chance to be involved in those moments. In cases where a business owner doesn’t have a child who wants to take over, they may look to sell to a similar company or private equity firm. Or if there’s someone in the company who’s interested in acquiring it but doesn’t have the capital, the bank can use an SBA loan to help with that pursuit. “We see great opportunities to help the next generation of business owners acquire business and a current generation who are at the end of their careers, exit, monetize what they've invested in, and have this sense that their legacy will continue,” O’Dell said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/us-bank-adding-business-bankers-southeast-odell/806212/,,
VALT Bank applies for de novo charter,"A group of former U.S. Bank executives is seeking federal approval to establish VALT Bank, applications submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Nov. 13 show. The proposed bank, headquartered in Eagle, Idaho, will be fully digital and will focus on serving “digitally demanding small to midsized businesses” in the U.S., according to its application. VALT plans to offer credit and deposit products as well as treasury and cash management services, and plans to provide clients with SMB-focused automation solutions. The bank will be led by proposed director, CEO and President Matt Gediman, whose nearly two-decade U.S. Bank career culminated in three years as a managing director in the bank’s private wealth management business. “When we refer to ‘digitally demanding SMBs,’ we mean revenue-generating small and midsized businesses that use technology across their daily operations and expect the same level of technological fluency from their financial service providers,” Gediman told Banking Dive via email Monday. These are traditional businesses, he added – not tech firms or crypto companies. VALT does not plan to interact with digital assets. “Our customers are established SMBs that simply expect modern, reliable, integrated digital banking,” he said. “[O]ur model is designed to support them by making banking uncomplicated, accessible, and integrated with digital tools to run their businesses more efficiently,” he said. Former U.S. Bank Vice Chairman John Elmore is VALT’s proposed executive chair and Ross Carey, former U.S. Bank EVP of business banking and SBA division, is its proposed vice chair. Kim Hoyt, attorney at Salem, Oregon-based law firm Garrett Hemann Robertson, and Dana Johnson, president and chief investment officer at single-family office MidAmerica Capital Partners, are VALT’s additional proposed directors. The OCC declined to comment on the application, and the FDIC did not respond immediately to a request for comment. But the heads of both agencies have recently spoken in favor of increased de novo chartering. Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gouldtold Banking Dive last monththat one of his major goals while at the helm of the OCC is “invigorating de novo chartering in America.” Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hillnoted earlier this year that new bank formationhas “fallen off a cliff” in recent years. At the American Bankers Association’s Washington Summit in April, he noted that 412 new banks were formed in 1984 alone, and that the lowest number of new banks established in any year between 1995 and 2007 was 93. By comparison, just 86 new banks have been formed since 2010, Hill said, and more than half of them came between 2019 and 2022 when Trump appointee Jelena McWilliams ran the FDIC. The OCC and the FDIC have received a number of bank applications since President Donald Trump took office again in January. Applicants includingCoinbaseandStripe-owned Bridgeseek national trust charters, which do not allow for lending or taking insured deposits. One bank – Erebor Bank, which applied for a de novo charter in June – has received conditional approval under Gould’s leadership. Its conditional approval wasgranted in October. TheOCC leasing manualindicates that the agency should make decisions on a charter application within 120 days of receiving it, lining VALT up for an answer by mid-March. Gediman, for VALT’s part, said the team’s intention is to “build a safe, well-governed institution that meets the needs of modern business owners through a unique digital-first experience.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/valt-bank-applies-for-de-novo-charter/806295/,,
CFPB can’t ignore judge’s order: workers union,"Lawyers for a workers unionurged a federal courtSunday to clarify apreliminary injunctionto ensure that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau leaders don’t shutter the agency by refusing funding. “The defendants have filed a ‘notice’ announcing that they intend to allow the Bureau to run out of funding, and when it does, they will stop complying with the Court’s injunction,” attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union wrote Sunday. “Parties may not simply declare that an injunction no longer applies.” The CFPB this monthalertedthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it “anticipates exhausting its currently available funds in early 2026.” At issue is the definition of “combined earnings.” The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel sent a memo to CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought on Nov. 7, asserting that it interprets earnings – from which the Federal Reserve derives the CFPB’s operating budget – as profit rather than revenue. By that math, the Fed has operated at a loss since 2022. NTEU attorneys asserted Sunday that the Fed earns “billions of dollars a year – from interest on loans and securities, and fees assessed” on banks. But because the Fed has raised interest rates since 2022, its combined interest expenses have exceeded combined earnings. The plaintiffs cite congressional testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told lawmakers the central bank examined that balance “very carefully” and concluded the law is “very clear” that the Fed must fund the CFPB even when its expenses exceed its earnings. Further, NTEU attorneys said, the OLC memo “admits, nobody – not any court, not the Fed, and not the CFPB – has ever interpreted” combined earnings as it suggested this month. “Both the Fed and the CFPB (until Vought needed a mechanism to circumvent this Court’s injunction) have consistently understood ‘combined earnings’ to mean, simply, everything the Fed earns,” NTEU attorneys wrote. The OLC’s interpretation relies on “technical definitions from corporate accounting,” NTEU attorneys wrote. “But the Fed is not a private corporation. It sets monetary policy for the United States. … The only reason to adopt its reading of ‘combined earnings’ is to shut down the CFPB.” Vought, in an appearance last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” indeed said of the CFPB: “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within thenext two, three months.” The bureau last week indicated it istransferring all of its active litigationto the DOJ. By the OLC’s logic, NTEU attorneys wrote, Congress would have passed a Dodd-Frank Act “that forces the Federal Reserve Board to choose between increasing interest rates to combat inflation and funding the CFPB.” “Fortunately, that is not the law that Congress wrote,” the attorneys asserted, blasting the CFPB for not choosing another path. “Rather than asking this Court to modify its injunction (which would require them to demonstrate that it should), the defendants have chosen to just ‘inform’ the Court that they ‘do not understand’ the injunction to bind them once the CFPB runs out of money – even if that’s because they decided not to ask the Fed for funding,” NTEU attorneys wrote. Outside of the courtroom, the CFPB on Friday issued what it termed a “humility pledge” meant to be read aloud by bank examiners to banks before exams. The statement drills down on the bureau’snarrowing of focustoward consumer threats that harm service members, veterans and their families and reiterates that the bureau will “avoid, where possible, duplication of supervision, where States or other regulators are already doing that job.” The bureau pledges shorter examination times – reduced from eight weeks to a period “commensurate with the defined scope of exams.” “No longer will the Bureau ask for expansive data sets or other information which may seem unrelated to the exam or include information inconsistent with Bureau priorities,” the pledge reads. “Any follow-up requests by examiners will first be discussed with an entity and will be tailored to the scope of the exam and the information already received from the entity.” The CFPB states its goal as “[to] work collaboratively with the entities to review entities’ processes for compliance and/or remedy existing problems,” emphasizing self-reporting and encouraging banks to resolve issues with the CFPB’s supervision unit, rather than enforcement. That may lend credence to a narrative, from an all-hands meeting of enforcement staff, in which the bureau’s acting enforcement chief said all 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation at the end of the year. Curiously, perhaps, the pledge encourages banks, if they find their exam experience to be “inconsistent with these principles,” to reach out via email to a designated CFPB supervisory official or the bureau’s chief legal officer. In apost Monday on the NTEU’s website, union member Alexis Goldstein asked, “Why is Russell Vought showing the world his weird, creepy pledge of allegiance to big corporations?” Another union member, Doug Wilson, notes a passage in the pledge in which the bureau asserts that examiners will be “encouraged and incentivized to complete the work promptly and under budget.” “This memo doesn't add up,” Wilson wrote. “Vought’s stopped all supervision exams in 2025, refuses to fund CFPB and says he’s shutting us down by 2026. So how will we supervise banks in 2026 if CFPB is closed? How can bank exams be ‘under budget’ if there is no budget?” In an emailed press release to accompany the humility pledge, the CFPB characterized the bureau’s Biden-era supervision efforts as “thuggery,” calling out ex-supervision chief LoreleiSalas as “a former [Democratic donor George] Soros activist who wasput on leave in February 2025.” Further, bureau leadership labeled the pre-Trump supervision unit as “a weaponized arm of the CFPB.” In aLinkedIn post, Allison Preiss, who until February served as senior adviser to the CFPB director, said the humility pledge “might be better characterized as a humiliation pledge.” “The notion that federal employees should genuflect, trembling, before a Wells Fargo or Bank of America, is some of the most ridiculous nonsense I've read all week,” she wrote. In anotherLinkedIn post, Tyler Creighton, counsel at the CFPB, took issue with the idea that the bureau is calling out examiners’ past conduct. “Supervision's workers have always conducted examinations professionally, efficiently, conscientiously, and with a focus on remedying consumer harm,” he wrote. “We will continue to do so, just as soon as Donald Trump and Russell Vought end the nearly 10-month suspension of examinations and let us get back to work for the American people.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-humility-pledge-supervision-enforcement-bank-examiners-fed-funding-refuse-vought-court/806314/,,
Stripe faces bank charter pushback,"A national trust banking charter would let the digital payments giant Stripe offer banking services while sidestepping certain regulations, an advocacy organization opposingthe payment provider's charter applicationargued in a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency this month. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition alsosaid in the letterthat the charter would give Stripe legitimacy that it does not deserve, pointing to the fintech’s history of legal trouble. Stripe, whichacquired a stablecoin infrastructure companycalled Bridge this year, proposes to name the bank Bridge National Trust. “The OCC must reject Stripe’s application for a national trust bank charter due to serious concerns regarding Stripe’s disregard for enforcement, governance, compliance, and consumer protection laws,” according to the Nov. 13 letter, which is addressed to Sebastian Astrada, the agency’s director for licensing of novel banks. The NCRC is a coalition of hundreds of U.S. community-based organizations which run the gamut from faith-based nonprofits to social justice advocates. The organization posted the letter on its website last week. Bridgeapplied for the charter in October. The charter would give Bridge and its parent company the right to provide custody, stablecoin issuance, and management of stablecoin reserves within a federal framework, rather than through state-to-state money transmitter licenses. Spokespeople for Stripe did not respond to messages seeking comment about the NCRC’s letter. If the charter is approved, Bridge would form the Bridge National Trust Bank, to be headquartered in New York City, according tothe Oct. 14 application. CEO Patrick Collison co-founded Stripe along with his brother John Collison, who is president of the business. “We’ve long believed stablecoins will be a core, regulated building block,” Bridge co-founder Zach Abrams wroteon the social media platform Xlast month. “This regulatory infrastructure will enable us to tokenize trillions of dollars and make this future possible.” The crypto firmsCircle,Paxos,RippleandCoinbasehave also applied for charters through the OCC, although none of those applications has been approved yet. With the trust, Stripe could also facilitate payments without supervision from the Federal Reserve, the NCRC said in its letter. “Granting these firms limited purpose trust charters would blur the statutory boundaries of what constitutes a bank, undermine the credibility of the national charter, and heighten systemic risk by allowing them to operate under a lighter regulatory regime,” the group wrote. The coalition also outlines some of the lawsuits and legal action taken against Stripe. In 2020, for example, the Massachusetts attorney general found Stripe had facilitated payments for a fraudulent cryptocurrency operation due to subpar risk monitoring and fraud prevention systems. The companyagreed to pay $120,000and improve its fraud control and employee training. The letter also lists several lawsuits against the company alleging, among other things, that Stripe failed to ensure customer privacy and protect customer data.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/stripe-faces-bank-charter-pushback/806315/,,
How the open banking rule skidded,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said this month it cannot draw funding to continue operations when its current funds lapse, presenting the agency a number of challenges in formulating an open banking rule quickly. The CFPBtold a federal courtNov. 11 that the Justice Department had concluded that the bureau cannot “lawfully draw funds” from the Federal Reserve System – which Congress designated as its funding source – and that the agency has funds to operate until year’s end. The bureau’s notice did not specify what would happen then, although the CFPB’s acting director, Russ Vought, has assailed the agency in the past and spoke publicly in October about itsclosure within months. The bureau has been working on a new open banking rule since July, when it told a federal court it would “substantially”revise the ruleand was granted a litigation stay of a lawsuitfiled last yearby banking trade groups. The CFPB did not respond to an email Monday seeking comment on the rule. Last week, the bureau notified employees that it wouldtransfer its litigation workto the DOJ and planned additional furloughs at year’s end. In its motion for a stay, the bureau told U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves it planned “an accelerated rulemaking process” to address what it considered to be deficiencies with the prior rule, enacted under the Biden administration. But any proposed rule with significant changes – such as allowing financial institutions to charge fees for access to customers’ data – would also require the bureau to assess the impacts to small businesses under the federal Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, attorneys noted. At that point, a public comment period on the proposed rule – typically 30 to 90 days – would begin. The CFPB would then consider those comments and issue a final rule. However, the bureau is considering skipping some parts of the rulemaking process to issue a rule by year’s end, potentially including a public comment period on its proposed rule,Bloomberg Law reportedThursday, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. “Given the polarized view of these rules by the banking and FinTech sectors, if either constituency objects to the substance of the CFPB’s revisions, additional litigation could ensue,” an attorney with law firm McGlinchey Stafford, Adam Maarec, wrote in a Septemberalertabout the process. “An ‘accelerated rulemaking’ still takes a long time,” added Maarec, who advises fintechs and banks. The prior rule took CFPB staff four years from the rulemaking notice to a final rule, he noted, adding “the scope of issues here seems significantly narrower.” Banking groups that sued the bureau last year leaned heavily on the Administrative Procedure Act for their complaint, arguing that the agency had overstepped its authority to impose “a complicated, costly, and fundamentally insecure mandatory data-sharing framework” that did not allow banks to recover their costs. Last month, Reeves issued apreliminary injunctionpreventing the bureau from enforcing its rule, pending the revised rule the CFPB is formulating. A spokesperson for the Bank Policy Institute said Monday the organization understands that the bureau’s rulemaking process is moving forward but declined to comment further, directing other queries to the agency. The Financial Data and Technology Association, which counts data aggregators Plaid and Yodlee as members, said it continues to oppose any effort allowing banks to impose fees for customer data. Both Plaid and Yodlee have announced agreements with the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase, in the past two months that include new fees for data access. The Dodd-Frank Act does not permit fees, which are “a competitive toll on consumers simply for exercising their right to access and share their own financial information,” FDATA Executive Director Steve Boms said Monday in an emailed statement. “If banks are given the green light to impose those fees in a new rule, it would fundamentally shift control of financial data away from consumers and toward already powerful incumbents.” A spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association declined to comment Friday on the CFPB’s future or rule process, as did the American Fintech Council on Monday. Vought, who also leads the Office of Management and Budget, has been trying todramatically downsizethe CFPB’s workforce and mission since he was appointed acting director in February. “We don’t have anyone working there except our Republican appointees and a few career [employees] that are doing statutory responsibilities while weclose down the agency,” Vought said last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months.” Conservative lawmakers and interest groups have targeted the bureau since Congress formed it 15 years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. “The CFPB is a highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency. It is unconstitutional,” the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote in its “Project 2025Mandate for Leadership” document, in a chapter written by Robert Bowes, ahousing department officialin the first Trump administration and a former Chase Manhattan banking executive. “The next conservative President should order the immediate dissolution of the agency — pull down its prior rules, regulations and guidance, return its staff to their prior agencies and its building to the General Services Administration.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-open-banking-rule-skidded-fintechs-banks-vought-court/806436/,,
Ex-Truist employee sentenced in ‘complex’ check-cashing scheme,"A former Truist branch employee is one of eight Georgia residents sentenced in a counterfeit check-cashing scheme that involved stolen check information, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgiasaid Wednesday. The “complex” check-cashing and kickback scheme ran from at least November 2021 to December 2022, prosecutors said. At the time, Mariarlene Brown, aka “Mati Mom,” 44, of Valdosta, worked at a Truist branch in that city. In conspiring with Brown and others to commit bank fraud, William Allen Roberts, 27, of Valdosta, unlawfully obtained check information from Vincent Galliard, 41, of Sumter, South Carolina. Galliard was a former U.S. Postal Service employee in South Carolina who sold checks he stole from the mail, prosecutors said. Roberts used the check information provided by Galliard to produce fraudulent checks. Six others involved in the scheme recruited people to open Truist bank accounts and then got those people to provide their new Truist debit card and account information to those behind the scheme, “with the understanding that they would be paid for doing so,” prosecutors said. That group of co-conspirators included Frederick Pernell Green, 27; Thomas Christopher Mitchell, 31; Calvin Dewayne McKeithen, aka “Supa,” 26; Dewayne Rasheen Butler, aka “Guwapo,” 26; Tyler Khershad Jones, aka “LA Clippers,” 24; and Davontay Wiseman, aka “Vonn,” 28. Those six then passed the account information on to Roberts, who would write checks to those individuals in various amounts. Roberts, with Brown’s help, deposited checks into those accounts, and Brown made sure Roberts could withdraw cash from the accounts, according to prosecutors. Roberts paid Brown for her help in the scheme, as well as the co-conspirators and account holders, prosecutors said. Green, Roberts, Mitchell, McKeithen, Jones, Butler and Wiseman kept most of each check that was deposited, prosecutors said. Text messages the group members exchanged described the conspiracy, and investigators also discovered photos of debit cards, account numbers, fraudulent checks, cash obtained from the check deposits “and a custom-made diamond ring in the shape of the Truist logo worn by Green,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Brown was sentenced to 33 months in prison, five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $390,475.84 in restitution to Truist on Oct. 9, after she pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Seven others – all except Galliard – also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, were sentenced to prison time and ordered to pay Truist restitution in the same amount. Galliard pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a South Carolina case and was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison, along with five years of supervised release, prosecutors said. Galliard was ordered to pay $149,692.14 in restitution divided among The Citizens Bank, First Citizens Bank, South Atlantic Bank, TD Bank, The Conway National Bank and Bank of America, according toa court filing. “Individuals who participate in check-cashing and kickback schemes will face imprisonment and other penalties,” U.S. Attorney Will Keyes said in the press release. “Investigators from the Secret Service and the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office worked to unravel this criminal network, ultimately preventing further theft and helping us ensure accountability for the defendants.” Bank regulators seek to bolster their efforts to address check fraud, which has grown “substantially” in the past several years, Michelle Bowman, the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision,said in June. Although check use has dropped, check fraud hasn’t diminished in tandem. “Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of real or attempted check fraud transactions grew nearly fourfold, even as the number of checks paid fell by more than 18 percent from 2018 to 2021,”the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantareported this year.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ex-truist-employee-sentenced-check-cashing-scheme/806169/,,
Citi CFO Mark Mason to step down in March,"Citi CFO Mark Mason, arguably the highest-profile Black executive at a U.S.-based global systemically important financial institution, will step down from his role in early March, the bankannounced Thursday. At that point, Gonzalo Luchetti, now the bank’s head of U.S. personal banking, will become CFO. Mason, meanwhile, will transition to executive vice chair and senior executive adviser to Citi CEO Jane Fraser, but he intends to pursue leadership opportunities outside the bank by the end of 2026, according to the announcement. In his adviser role, Mason will help Citi prepare for its investor day May 7 and give guidance on the bank’s strategic initiatives. Mason has been a key figure in Citi’stwo-year reorganization, in which the bank set out to simplify its structure,trim its headcount by 20,000employees by 2026, and embrace tech modernization meant to free it fromtwo 2020 consent orders. Citi launched further reorganization Thursday, saying it would integrate its retail bank into its wealth business. The move arguably hands more responsibility to wealth chief Andy Sieg. The bank’s U.S. Everyday Banking, Citi Priority, Citigold and Citigold Private Client labels will be consolidated into a single group led by Kate Luft. Luft, who has served as head of U.S. retail bankingsince April, will add “and Citigold” to her title and report to Sieg. With the move, “U.S. Personal Banking” will no longer be one of Citi’s five core businesses, the company said. But it will be replaced by “U.S. Consumer Cards,” which will combine the bank’s branded cards and retail services businesses under Pam Habner. Habner, who has served as Citi’s head of branded cards and lendingsince 2020, will join the bank’s executive management team and report directly to Fraser. “This evolution of our leadership team and structure is well timed as it puts in place our next generation of leaders ahead of our upcoming Investor Day, when we will lay out our plans to further grow our returns,” Fraser said Thursday in a statement. “We are ending the year with momentum and confidence.” Mason’s upcoming transition comes less than a month after Citi threw added support behind Fraser,naming her chairand giving her a $25 million equity award meant to keep her in place for years to come. Fraser on Thursday called Mason “an invaluable partner” who “models integrity, drive and commitment no matter the circumstances, and has always put the firm first.” “Mark has proven himself to be a leader for all seasons, having helped Citi navigate some of our most challenging times and being a driving force behind the results we are now seeing in our performance and our Transformation,” Fraser said, citing the capitalized term the bank gives its tech modernization. Mason joined Citi in 2001 and has been CFO since 2019 – but between those benchmarks has served as CEO of Citi’s private bank, CEO of Citi Holdings, and CFO of the bank’s Institutional Clients Group, according to hisLinkedIn profile. “Serving as CFO for the last seven years and contributing to a leadership team that is redefining expectations for Citi stands as one of the most demanding and fulfilling chapters of my career,” Mason said in a statement Thursday. “I know that Gonzalo will work tirelessly with the strong team we’ve built across Finance to further Citi’s momentum, and I am fully committed to his smooth transition into the new role.” Scott Siefers, a managing director and senior research analyst for Piper Sandler, called Mason’s departure “an unfortunate loss” for Citi. “Thankfully, he will be succeeded by an insider with deep experience,” Siefers wrote in a note seen by Banking Dive. Luchetti joined Citi in 2006 and has served, among other roles, as consumer banking chief for Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and as global head of wealth management and insurance, according to hisLinkedIn profile. He became head of U.S. personal banking in 2021 and on Thursday earned plaudits from Fraser for expanding his segment’s return on tangible common equity to 14.5% for 2025’s third quarter. “I knew exactly what we needed in our next CFO to build on Mark’s successful tenure,” Fraser said. “In addition to the table-stakes requirement of superb financial acumen, it must be someone who is strategically minded, data-driven, analytical, and an excellent operator. … Gonzalo is that person.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-mark-mason-cfo-step-down-march-gonzalo-luchetti-fraser-sieg-luft-habner/806137/,,
Wells Fargo taps Saul Van Beurden to scale AI,"Saul Van Beurden, chief executive of Wells Fargo consumer and small business banking,has been tappedto scale artificial intelligence at the bank, the lender said Thursday. Additionally, the bank’s CEO for consumer lending, Kleber Santos, will take on added responsibilities as co-CEO of consumer lending and banking as Wells formally combines the businesses, allowing Van Beurden to focus more on AI. “Generative and agentic AI will reshape competitive dynamics across every industry, and we are embracing these tools as we have embraced robotic process automation and machine learning for years,” Wells CEO Charlie Scharf said in a prepared statement. In August, Wells gave branch bankers, investment bankers, customer relations and corporate teamsaccess to AI agents and toolsfrom Google Cloud. The tools help employees sort through massive loads of documentation and provide real-time market insights, among other things. Wells is among banks in a near-ubiquitous industry pushtoward AI-fueled efficiencies. Wells has trained some 90,000 employees on AI this year, deployed AI tools to many others and is now broadening its uses, Scharf said. “Our employees and customers have powerful models in their hands. They expect the same at work,” Van Beurden toldForbesthis month on AI. “GenAI helps remove simple repetitive tasks, builds workflows and frees people to do higher-value work. We are scratching the surface.” The key is to deploy AI in ways that “enhance human performance rather than replace it,” he told Forbes. In his enhanced role, Van Beurden will help leaders in Wells’ businesses oversee transformation in their own segments, Scharf said in a prepared statement. “Success will be driven by business heads embracing these new technologies and rethinking their own operating models using generative and agentic AI solutions,” Scharf said. The advances in AI, he added, “have given us a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform how we work and we are excited by what we can deliver for our employees, customers and communities.” Van Beurden joined Wells in2019 from JPMorgan Chase, where he was chief information officer of consumer and community banking. The San Francisco-based bankelevated him in 2023from head of technology to CEO of consumer and small-business banking.

CFPB is transferring its cases to DOJ,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is transferring all of its active litigation to the Justice Department, according to separate statements Thursday from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, and the workers union representing the agency. Further, Mike Salemi, the CFPB’s acting enforcement chief, said at an all-hands meeting Thursday that, as he understood it, all bureau employees would be furloughed at the end of the year,Government Executivereported, citing people familiar with the matter. Salemi hedged, saying he was not privy to all of the plans, but that the information came from an associate general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget who also serves as a senior legal adviser at the CFPB. The timeline, if true, would dovetail with a projection CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought made in a podcast appearance last month, when he said the only employees left at the bureau were “our Republican appointees and a few career [staff] that are doing statutory responsibilities while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the nexttwo, three months,” Vought said. Further, DOJ attorneys filed paperwork last week with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, indicating the CFPB “anticipates exhaustingits currently available funds in early 2026.” The filing was meant to flag a “potential lapse in appropriations” to pay the bureau’s operating expenses. The court this year granted apreliminary injunctionpreventing the CFPB from firing the vast majority of its staff. Included in the filing was a memo the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel sent Vought, asserting that the bureau may not legally request funds at this time from the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. Salemi on Thursday said the 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation, according to Government Executive. A few top officials may have the opportunity to work for DOJ,American Bankerreported, citing people who were part of the all-hands call. Salemi noted that the DOJ stood up an enforcement and affirmative litigation unit within its Civil Division in September. Salemi told CFPB staff he assumed the agency’s work would be routed there beginning in 2026, according to Government Executive. Cat Farman, president of the National Treasury Employees Union 335, which represents CFPB employees, said Vought has “no legal authority” to transfer the bureau’s cases to the DOJ. “This is Russ Vought’s latest illegal power grab in his ongoing plan to shut down the CFPB,” Farman said in a statement on theNTEU’s website. However, the Dodd-Frank Act indicates the DOJ has the authority to handle cases where no agency is designated to do so by law,Bloomberg Lawreported. Before the CFPB was established in 2011, the DOJ took cases under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act because no other agency had the power. The CFPB is still litigating 13 cases, Farman said, though Vought this year has dismissed 22 enforcement actions brought by the bureau under previous administrations. “CFPB attorneys are afraid DOJ will dismiss [the remaining] cases,” Farman said. The DOJ declined to comment. The CFPB didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Warren, the senator credited as the architect of the bureau, appeared to hold tight to her suspicions. “Donald Trump and Russ Vought are racing to shut down the CFPB while their lawyers tell the courts the opposite,”Warren wrotein a statement Thursday. “Nobody is fooled about the Trump-Vought end game, and the courts must uphold the law.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-transfer-litigation-doj-enforcement-furloughs-salemi-vought/806193/,,
"TD illegally targeted, fired Chinese-heritage employees: lawsuit","Five former TD Bank employees of Chinese heritage say the bank illegally fired them in the wake of TD’s fentanyl-tied money laundering scandal,court documents show. Plaintiffs Andrew Wong, Ka Po Wong, Anne Louie, April Ng and Millie Su allege that TD “intentionally targeted and disproportionately impacted the bank’s Chinese and Chinese American employees” to placate investigators as they probed the lender’santi-money laundering control issues, and to “give the appearance of robust AML procedures.” The bank’s “robust enforcement” went “far beyond the normal scope” in investigating the employees’ personal transaction histories, particularly cash exchanges that moved through their bank accounts, the plaintiffs said. Chinese families traditionally borrow money from family and friends, rather than banks, and it’s common for family members to gift funds for large purchases, such as a house, plaintiffs said, citing a “financial culture [that] is prevalent in the Chinese diaspora, including the Chinese-American community.” The investigators did not take that into account, the plaintiffs asserted. In one instance, investigators pressed Ng on a $500 transaction in new bills meant as a gift during Chinese New Year, a custom. In another, investigators questioned Su about $15,000 in cash she received from family members. The funds, intended as a house down payment gift to a family associate, were deposited into Su’s account. She added $5,000 from her account, and wrote the associate a $20,000 check. “The targeted Chinese and Chinese American employees provided proof that transactions questioned by TD were legitimate, yet each still suffered the most severe adverse employment action possible. They were terminated,” plaintiffs allege. “More callously, the terminated Chinese and Chinese American were demarketed from TD Bank. TD closed their personal and business accounts, and, upon information and belief, barred them from banking with TD in the future.” Prior to the fentanyl-tied AML investigation, TD “leveraged the national origin of its Chinese and Chinese American employees to foster trust in the Chinese community and build their business,” plaintiffs said. During the investigation, however, TD’s Chinese and Chinese American employees “were then targeted by the bank because of their ethnicity and national origin. They were punished for crimes committed by other Chinese individuals — crimes they were not involved in by individuals they did not know.” “Their Chinese heritage, once used by TD Bank to garner trust in the Chinese community, now became a target for TD,” plaintiffs said. Due to TD’s investigations of its Chinese and Chinese American employees in the New York City’s Chinatown branches alone, at least 22 employees were terminated or subject to adverse employment actions, the lawsuit asserted. All but one of the terminated employees were of Chinese origin. At least one employee was terminated for a transaction with a Chinese American employee, according to court documents. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement at their respective jobs, back pay and emotional damages sustained as a result of TD’s conduct. A TD spokesperson told Banking Dive that the bank has no comment, given that the litigation is pending. Arthur Schwartz, an attorney for the plaintiffs, did not respond to a request for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/td-illegally-targeted-fired-chinese-heritage-employees-lawsuit/806066/,,

Capital One joins FedNow,"Capital One joined the Federal Reserve’s instant payments system FedNow this week, leaving Bank of America and Truist among the major U.S. financial institutions not participating in that real-time ecosystem. Capital One started its FedNow participation Tuesday, a spokesperson for the bank said by email. “Financial Institutions of all sizes are rapidly enabling instant payments for their accountholders,” U.S. Faster Payments Council CEO Reed Luhtanen said by email, when asked for comment on how the system is developing. “The ability to offer instant money movement is becoming table stakes in our 21st century economy, and financial institutions that don’t have a faster payments strategy need to develop one, and fast.” A spokesperson for Bank of America didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson confirmed late last month that the bank had not yet joined FedNow. FedNow has attracted all but two of theeight biggest U.S. retail banks, according to a list of participants on theFederal Reserve’s FedNow website. The service allows for the transfer of payments between banks in seconds or minutes, as opposed to some alternatives that take days. While about 1,550 U.S. financial institutions have joined the FedNow system since itlaunched in July 2023, there are thousands that have not, despite the central bank’s efforts to attract smaller banks as well. In all, there are about 9,000 U.S. financial institutions, including large banks, smaller regional and community banks, and credit unions. (Only U.S. financial institutions are allowed to connect to the FedNow system.) Nonetheless, the large banks are the most active in the payments sphere. The 50 biggest banks operating in the U.S. account for more than 90% of payment originations on the major clearing systems operated by The Clearing House andNacha, based on those organizations’ statistics. To smooth the way to joining the system, the Fed is trying to make it as easy as possible. Currently, the “record” time period for onboarding a bank — from signing a contract with the central bank to offering services — is seven days, FedNow Chief Executive Nick Stanescusaid in a video poston FedNow’s website Tuesday. He noted there are also 41 certified service providers that aid in bringing bank clients to the system. To boost transaction volume, FedNow has been gradually increasing the maximum amount that can be sent over the system.

Lloyds to buy UK fintech Curve,"London-based Lloyds Bank will buy theU.K. fintech Curve, the bankannounced Wednesday. Lloyds did not disclose the price point for the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2026. But the acquisition lends credence to aSky Newsreport from last week, indicating the bank would pay £120 million for the digital wallet provider. That’s less than half the £250 million in funding Curve is said to have raised since its founding in 2015. And it’s far below the valuation CEO Shachar Bialick had targeted for the company. “In ten years’ time we are going to be IPO-ed … and hopefully worth around $50 billion to $60 billion,” Bialick, a former Israeli special forces soldier, toldThe Times of Londonin 2019, using the acronym for initial public offering. In a circular to investors last week, Curve said it “share[s] the disappointment some of you may have in this outcome.” “We recognize that the value of this transaction falls short of the ambitions we all held for Curve,” the company said in the note, seen by Sky News. “Yet, the board strongly believes this transaction represents the best available path forward for Curve's creditors and shareholders as a whole."" However, IDC Ventures, an investor that holds a 12% stake in Curve, said in a statement Friday it is ""deeply concerned about the conduct of Curve's management and board during the current sale process."" IDC alleged a small group of directors and investors at Curve “facilitated corporate decision-making to entrench control and override shareholder rights,” adding that “issues regarding [Curve’s] governance and ownership are disputed.” The investor sought toremove Curve's chairin September, but the effort failed. IDC has consistently opposed a sale to Lloyds since rumors of a potential transaction became public in July. The investor wrote “repeatedly” to Curve and its board, opposing the sale, “without receiving any meaningful response or engagement,” it asserted in September. IDC also said it wrote to Lloyds, but the bank did not respond. “It is a matter of real surprise to shareholders that Lloyds Banking Group, a leading UK institution, would contemplate proceeding with a transaction that IDC believes is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders,” IDC wrote Friday, adding it “does not believe” a sale could be “implemented” without the investor’s support. Curve’s auditors earlier this year had warned of “material uncertainty” at the firm, according toCityAM. Financial figures published in March revealed the company had paused its plans to expand to the U.S. and, in 2023, cut about a third of its workforce, according totech.eu. Curve reported a pretax loss of £36 million in 2023, up from £69 million the year before. Bialick, when asked if Curve would be profitable in 2024, said the company’s “priority is sustainable expansion, and we anticipate reaching break-even in the near term.” Curve touts a digital wallet platform that brings all of a user’s cards and alternative payment sources into one place, while offering payment flexibility, real-time spend insights and no foreign exchange fees. In a statement onCurve’s blog Wednesday, Bialick said Curve’s “mission” has always been to “simplify and supercharge people’s finances.” “Joining forces with Lloyds Banking Group means we can now scale that vision faster, helping tens of millions more customers unlock smarter payments, and empower greater financial accessibility,” he said. Curve, on its own, counts 6 million customers. Lloyds, by comparison, reaches 28 million. The bank announced in January it planned toclose 136 branchesin the U.K. as customers rely more heavily on digital banking. Buying a digital wallet platform, presumably, would dovetail with that vision. “Building on the innovative changes we’ve made to our app recently, integrating Curve’s cutting-edge technology and digital wallet capabilities will deliver a next-generation digital banking experience for our customers as we help them to take control of their finances in a simple and convenient way,” Jas Singh, CEO of consumer relationships at Lloyds, said in a release Wednesday. Lloyds said Wednesday the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the bank, or to affect full-year guidance for 2025 or 2026.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/lloyds-bank-uk-acquire-fintech-curve-digital-wallet-120-million-idc-investor-concern/806065/,,
NY AG’s office scrutinizes SoLo Funds,"Fintech lender SoLo Funds is engaged with the New York attorney general’s office related to usury concerns, an executive said this week. Denzel Singletary, head of government affairs and strategic partnerships at the company, said SoLo Funds was served a subpoena this year by state AG Letitia James’ office. “We're in negotiations with them now, figuring out … what common ground looks like,” Singletary said, speaking Monday at the Banking Transformation Summit in Charlotte, North Carolina, on the topic of fintechs and regulators working together. James’ office declined to comment Tuesday. After SoLo Funds was subpoenaed, “my job initially was to make sure New York knew that we were not working in a nefarious way,” Singletary said. He said he highlighted the fintech’s community platform and tried to dispel misconceptions customers are being charged exorbitant interest rates. SoLo Funds bills itself as a community finance platform. Its business model has drawn the attention of regulators in a handful of states who view its “tip” structure asa predatory lending practice. In recent years, SoLo hasreached agreements with regulatorsin California, Washington, D.C., Connecticut and Pennsylvania related toallegations borrowers were required to pay large “tips” to access loans through its platform. In May 2024,the Los Angeles-based fintech was suedby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau,then under the Biden administration, also took issue with SoLo’s “tip” structure, which it said obscured the total cost of loans. The CFPB also said SoLo, which marketed itself as a consumer-friendly alternative to pricier, short-term loans, hid from borrowers the option to forgo a tip, and offered loans to borrowers in states that require platforms to have a license. SoLo said it had long since changed some components of its display the CFPB called out in the lawsuit. In February, under the Trump administration, the CFPBdropped the lawsuitagainst SoLo Funds. Russ Vought, the CFPB’s acting director who also leads the OMB, said at the time that the bureau under former director Rohit Chopra “shockingly” tried to “destroy” SoLo, “which incurred millions in legal fees and had to lay off 30% of its workforce.” “It was wrong and we dismissed the case,” Vought said. Prior tojoining SoLo Funds in 2024, Singletary was the director of U.S. government affairs at investing fintech Robinhood. “When SoLo Funds reached out to me to come and work with them,” he said, “it was this opportunity of figuring out, how do I make this fintech work well with regulators? What can I do to strengthen this relationship with this particular fintech and regulators?” That task was made far more difficult when, two weeks after he joined SoLo Funds, the firm was sued by the CFPB. He called that “a very interesting intro into the company,” but said he wasn’t deterred in seeking to make sure the regulator and the fintech understood each other. Then came a “blessing” in the form of the presidential administration change in January, Singletary said. “It was an opportunity for us to state our case in front of a new body, really,” he said. In doing that, the fintech focused on its community of users. “What does this whole community look like? What is this application actually doing? Who is it actually helping?” he said. “The customers are always going to make it make sense for the regulators,” he said. “I highlighted the fact that even though there's misconceptions, that we were facing those and actually working through them.” SoLo Funds became the first company to have a lawsuit dismissed by the current CFPB, which has since dropped a number of lawsuits filed under the Biden administration. “I genuinely think that's because we highlighted the community,” Singletary said. “Bodies really matter” when it comes to cooperation between fintechs and regulators. As the CFPB has reversed course on a number of actions, James has been quick to pick up the mantle in New York. Her officesued Capital Oneover lost interest payments to consumers andsued Early Warningover alleged fraud at Zelle – and initiated both after the CFPB dropped similar lawsuits this year. James’ office has also filed lawsuits against earned wage access providersMoneyLion and DailyPay, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to thousands of workers. Travis Holoway and Rodney Williams, the founders of SoLo Funds, soughtto establish an alternative to costly payday lenders, Singletary said. They“were two college-educated men who had made it, and their friends and family were consistently asking them for loans,” Singletary said.

Senators back open banking rule,"Several Senate Democrats on Thursday called on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to keep pursuing open banking rules that give consumers the ability to easily shift their personal data from one financial institution to another. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut pressed CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought in a letter seen by Payments Dive to continue the federal agency’s work in writing a rule under the Dodd-Frank Act that would further such consumer rights, without fees. The agency issued such a rule last year during the Biden administration, but bank trade groups sued over the regulation and it has been tied up in court. Under Vought’s leadership, the agency stopped backing the Biden-era rule in the litigation, which a judge has stayed, pending the agency’s decision to rewrite the rule. At the same time, Vought is aggressively shrinking the agency and threatening to shutter it, leaving the rule’s future in doubt. “We are concerned that the Trump CFPB’s policymaking seems to be more driven by the seesawing interests of big banks and other industry groups than with protecting consumers’ rights to their own data, as mandated by law,” the senators wrote in their letter. The senators alsoissued a press releaseThursday, insisting Vought reinstate the priorPersonal Financial Data Rights rule. “In the absence of the rule, big banks have demonstrated that they intend to charge exorbitant fees for this data to choke off competition and concentrate this data in the hands of a few large incumbents,” the senators wrote. The senators also contended that banks should not be allowed to charge for access to the data, saying it would be a violation of the law. “Large financial institutions have a monopoly over large swaths of consumer data and thus have the potential to drive out competitors and start ups in the data sharing market,” the letter said. The senators specifically called out JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, for imposing fees this year on third-party data aggregators, including the fintech Plaid. That bank’s fees were “at rates high enough to paralyze the market,” the letter said, noting that PayPal’s peer-to-peer payment tool Venmo and neobank Chime use Plaid to connect users’ bank accounts to their apps. JPMorgan Chase was set to impose an estimated $300 million in new fees annually on Plaid, the senators said, citing an article from Forbes, before the companies reached an agreement in September on terms that weren’t disclosed. JPMorgan Chase’s initial fee structure “indicates where the market may be moving absent the CFPB’s rule,” the letter said. A second data aggregator, Yodlee, this month said it had reached anupdated agreementwith JPMorgan Chase over access fees. The senators argued that “it is critical that any revisions the CFPB makes to the Personal Financial Data Rights rule recognize the importance of consumers being able to exercise their rights, which includes deciding how and by whom their data is used.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/open-banking-cfpb-warren-wyden-blumenthal-vought-jpmorgan-plaid-chime-venmo-yodlee/806190/,,
Florida credit union to buy Georgia bank,"Jacksonville, Florida-based Community First Credit Union of Florida will buy Waycross, Georgia-based First Southern Bank, creating a $3.3 billion-asset institution, thecredit union announced Tuesday. The deal, which would extend the credit union’s footprint into southeast Georgia and elsewhere into Florida, is thesecond CU-bank tie-up announced this week,after El Paso, Texas-based GECU proposed buying Roswell, New Mexico-based Bank of the Southwest on Monday. “While we love the growth opportunities that come with the transaction, this acquisition is founded on a unified vision between Community First and First Southern Bank,” Sam Inman, CEO of Community First, said in a prepared statement. “Both institutions emphasize a community-oriented and relationship-based approach, maintaining a culture that respects individuals and prioritizes service excellence.” Both institutions are storied: Community First is 90 years old. First Southern is 118 years old. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both institutions, is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2026. After that, First Southern’s holding company will liquidate, dissolve and distribute any remaining assets to its stockholders. The new Community First will count roughly $2.5 billion in loans and $2.9 billion in deposits across 31 branches. “First Southern Bank customers will continue to see their trusted familiar banker at each location,” said First Southern CEO Daniel Hager in a prepared statement. “The newly combined institution will have the ability to offer highly personalized financial services, which will enable us the financial capabilities to support further expansion.” Community First plans to retain all First Southern employees, stretching its headcount to 530. “Combining will expand services and strengthen community impact,” Community First said in a Q&A on its website. Tie-ups between credit unions and banks are not without challengers.Independent Community Bankers of America CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey released a statement Tuesday calling for policymakers “to address the harmful impact these deals have on local communities.” CitingICBA data, Rainey said the deals harm “small businesses and local communities while community banks outperform credit unions in high-poverty areas.” She called for Congress to eliminate the federal tax exemption for credit unions with more than $1 billion in assets. More than 80% of deals since 2010 have involved credit unions of that size, ICBA found. Four in 10 deals have involved a credit union headquartered in a different state than the acquired bank. Small Business Administration lending fell almost 80% at community banks that were acquired by credit unions, according to ICBA, and the amount loaned per approved mortgage application at the institutions decreased 61%. Michael Bell, a partner at Honigman who often architects such deals – including this one – told Banking Dive that ICBA’s statements are without “substance.” “The ICBA equates size to evil for some reason,” he said. “I ask the ICBA, is a $1 billion community bank still a community bank? Should all community banks larger than $1 billion give up the many tax subsidies enjoyed by community banks?”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/florida-credit-union-buy-georgia-bank/805897/,,
White House nominates Vought aide to lead CFPB,"Additionally, Geof Gradler was named deputy director of the CFPB. He’s a former lobbyist who joined the bureau about four months ago, according tohis LinkedIn profile. The CFPB spokesperson declined to comment on the fate of the agency, or whether the bureau intended to make a similar move in another 210 days. Vought said last monthon a podcast that onlyRepublican appointees and a few career employees remain “while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months,” Vought said. Trump administration officials have tried repeatedly this yearto hobble or shutterthe agency but have, at times run into court-ordered roadblocks. The CFPB spokesperson said the hearing process likely will be a moot point for Levenbach. The Senate probably wouldn’t get around to it until next year, the spokesperson said, and with Vought not going anywhere, the formal process may not occur. Michael Emancipator, senior vice president and regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America,noted on LinkedInWednesday that Levenbach’s nomination appears to be “merely a resetting of the clock” under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. And McGuireWoods partner Jeff Ehrlich, a former deputy enforcement director at the CFPB, said the nomination is “likely a placeholder,” according toa LinkedIn post. The spokesperson pointed toa news releasethe bureau issued last week, in which the CFPB said itinformed the court inNTEU v. Voughtthat the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the CFPBcan’t legally request fundsfrom the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB “anticipates having sufficient funds to continue operations until at least December 31,” the release said.DOJ attorneys told the court that available funds are expected to run out in early 2026. Levenbach is also vice chair of theNational Capital Planning Commission, a panel that Voughtthreatened to involvein this summer’s dust-up over an over-budget renovation at the Federal Reserve. Levenbach served as chief of staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during Trump’s first term. Later, he became a senior adviser with the White House National Economic Council and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, according tohis LinkedIn profile. Prior to those roles, he spent about a decade at OMB. “Donald Trump’s sending the Senate a new nominee to lead the CFPB looks like nothing more than a front for Russ Vought to stay on as Acting Director indefinitely as he tries to illegally close down the agency,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a Wednesday statement. “Instead of doing everything in their power to lower costs for Americans, Trump and Vought want to make it easier for giant corporations to scam families out of their money.” Consumer Bankers Association CEO Lindsey Johnson said Levenbach’s nomination “comes at a critical time for consumers and the financial services marketplace.” “America’s leading Main Street banks look forward to continuing to work with the Trump Administration on data-driven, pro-growth policies that will support hardworking Americans and drive the economy forward, while at the same time ensuring the Bureau fulfills its statutory mission and sticks to what Congress authorized it to do,” she said in a Wednesday statement. “This will not only help restore the trust and credibility of the CFPB, but will benefit consumers, industry, and the broader economy alike.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-director-levenbach-vought-omb-trump/805913/,,
LevelField gets state approval to buy Chicago bank,"LevelField filed a fresh application to buy Burling inDecember 2024. In that paperwork, the Houston firm said it would pay roughly $70 million for the bank, which counts a single branch and $209.5 million in assets. The combined entity will be renamed LevelField Bank but maintain Burling’s community banking business. However, it will add a focus on deposit accounts, loans and custody services tailored to digital assets, including term loans and credit cards secured by bitcoin or Ether, according to the application. Burling's CEO, Michael Busch, will become president of LevelField Bank, Grant said. From the beginning, LevelField said it sought to become the first full-service chartered bank to offer traditional banking and digital asset services on one platform across the U.S. ""The idea is, once we have a customer, they don't have to go outside the bank perimeter for anything they want to do in digital assets,” Grant told American Banker. Grant said he expects acquisition to be finalized by the end of this year. Only Burling’s cannabis banking business will retain the Burling brand, LevelField said. To accommodate the anticipated round-the clock needs of its digital-asset user base, LevelField aims to hire roughly 100 employees in 2026 – mostly in customer service, Grant said. Once LevelField receives regulatory approval, it aims to raise $112.5 million, according to its December 2024 filing. That is meant to cover the acquisition of the bank, $20 million in growth capital and $17.5 million that LevelField will retain, the company said. In a release Monday, Grant thanked investors “for backing the patient, disciplined work it took to meet the necessary supervisory standards that protect consumers and businesses and make the U.S. the home of the world leading banking system."" As far as embracing crypto, Grant said the banking system can either ""live in denial or we can try to safely integrate it … in such a way that it works collaboratively and doesn't endanger the system."" “Financial services must be changed from the inside, and unlike other industries, outside disruptors barely move the needle,” Granttold Bloomberg.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/levelfield-acquire-burling-bank-illinois-regulator-approval-crypto-digital-asset/805947/,,
FDIC countersues Capital One over special assessment,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. accused Capital One of paying $99.4 million less than necessary to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund following the 2023 failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, according tocourt documents filed Monday. The FDIC’s lawsuit countered legal action takenin Septemberagainst the regulator by the bank, which alleged the FDICimposed an “outsized and improperly calculated” special assessment fee on Capital One. The FDIC inflated its assessment against Capital One by $149.2 million, the bank said in September. At issue is a $56 billion position between two Capital One subsidiaries which, according to Monday’s lawsuit, Capital One excluded in its reporting of uninsured deposits. Capital One said the agency “erroneously” included the position as uninsured deposits, inflating what the bank owed. The FDIC used funds from the DIF to protect uninsured depositors when banks fail. When SVB and Signature Bank were seized by the FDIC in March 2023, most of their deposits – 88% and 67%, respectively – were above the FDIC’s $250,000 threshold and “uninsured.” To recoup DIF funds later that year, the FDIC implemented a special assessment on the nation’s largest banks, including Capital One. The FDIC argued Monday that Capital One benefits from deposit insurance, and that the funds were “deposits held at the bank for which the subsidiary already received the benefit of FDIC deposit insurance.” ""There are no time machines when it comes to special assessments,” the FDIC said. Capital One and the FDIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fdic-countersues-capital-one-over-special-assessment/805937/,,
JPMorgan Chase enhancing due diligence for clients in the Amazon region,"The change itself does not come with any inherent restrictions on client activities or transactions in the region, but a JPMorgan spokesperson told ESG Dive on Wednesday that each activity and transaction will be considered “on a case-by-case basis, in line with [its] risk appetite and commercial interests.” “Managing risk is critical to the long-term success of our business,” the bank’s spokesperson said in emailed comments. “We added Amazon Biome as one example of a business location associated with clients and/or transactions we consider sensitive or in need of enhanced review, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.” The RAISG geospatial definition, which JPMorgan will use to define the biome, “is widely recommended by Indigenous leaders and activists,” according to Stand.earth. Allison Fajans-Turner, a senior campaigner at the Rainforest Action Network — one of the environmental organizations backing the annual Banking on Climate Chaos reports — said requiring enhanced due diligence for activities in the Amazon biome is “the bare minimum that we should expect from other large backers of Amazon drilling.” “JPMorgan Chase has finally taken an essential — if long-overdue — step to confront its role as the largest financier of oil and gas extraction in the Amazon,” Fajans-Turner said in Stand.earth’s Nov. 13 release. After 30% of JPMorgan’s shareholders supported a proposal to require the bank to issue a report on its practices on Indigenous People's rights in the 2024 proxy season, JPMorgan reached an agreement with shareholders proposing a similar filing in the most recent proxy season. The United Church Fundwithdrew its proposal to the bankin April — afterJPMorgan submitted a no-action requeston the filing — once the bank agreed to add a disclosure stating “the company will consider free, prior and informed consent where risks are identified before proceeding with transactions that may have material implications for Indigenous Peoples.” “Promises on paper to respect Indigenous and human rights and screen clients operating in the Amazon biome fall far short of what’s needed: real financing exclusions applied to the Amazon and other fragile ecosystems and rigorous implementation of human rights protections for Indigenous peoples and all affected local communities,” Fajans-Turner said in the Nov. 13 release. In addition to the Arctic and the Amazon, JPMorgan requires a case-by-case enhanced review for coal mining and coal-fired power activities; clients whose “main business is the physical trading of conflict minerals,” cobalt or diamond trading; and hydropower, agricultural commodities or downstream agricultural commodity use in non-designated countries.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-enhancing-due-diligence-amazon-region-clients-standearth/806007/,,
Investor blasts Comerica over Fifth Third deal,"Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management on Monday probed Comerica’s $10.9 billion deal to be acquired by Fifth Third and threatened legal action against the bank if more information on the deal process isn’t released. Additionally, Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions was Comerica’s first suitor, before the Dallas-based bank struck a deal with Fifth Third,American Bankerreported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Spokespeople for Regions and Fifth Third declined to comment. A Comerica spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July,accusing the regional lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” HoldCo, whichowns about 2.04 million shares of Comerica stock,suggested PNC, Fifth Third or Huntington as possible buyers. In October, Fifth Third said it wasacquiring Comerica for $10.9 billionin stock. Earlier this month,a regulatory filingrevealed that the Cincinnati-based lender was not Comerica’s first suitor. The CEO of another bank, identified as Financial Institution A in the filing, proposed an all-stock transaction with $78 billion-asset Comerica in September. But Comerica’s board determined the terms “were not likely to be more attractive than the consideration that could be offered by another counterparty.” HoldCo’s65-page presentation issued Monday, which parsed recent regulatory filings, alleged a lack of board oversight in Comerica CEO Curt Farmer’s interactions with Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence and the absence of a competitive process in the Fifth Third deal, saying “this isn’t negotiation; it’s surrender.” HoldCo accused Comerica’s board of ignoring Financial Institution A’s proposals, a choice it called “indefensible,” and contended “had you engaged, we believe those ‘preliminary’ bids would have matured into definitive proposals — at likely materially higher levels.” HoldCo also critiqued Farmer’s “windfall” – he’s set to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks – and the deal’s “aggressive” breakup fee of $500 million. The acquisition is set to face a shareholder vote in January. HoldCo demanded a raft of details, calling on Comerica to “provide a more complete and transparent chronology of the events leading up to the Fifth Third transaction.” That includes when the board first discussed potential responses to shareholder pressure and when it authorized Comerica management to explore a merger, as well as information on the identity of Financial Institution A, the timing, substance and financial terms of its proposals, and whether Comerica or its advisers engaged with that bank. “The apparent absence of any follow-up engagement with a bidder who made an offer — combined with the lack of evidence that J.P. Morgan sought to create competition between bidders — suggests a process engineered to favor Fifth Third rather than one designed to maximize shareholder value,” the activist investor said. HoldCo also pressed for details on the decision to hire JPMorgan Chase as Comerica’s financial adviser, and seeks more specifics related to Farmer’s conversations with Spence. “The size and timing of Mr. Farmer’s compensation package strongly indicate a potential conflict of interest — namely, that Fifth Third effectively ‘overpaid’ the CEO to secure a lower purchase price for shareholders,” the activist said. If the bank doesn’t provide the requested detail, “we will have to consider seeking expedited relief in the Delaware Court of Chancery to obtain the disclosures we believe are warranted,” HoldCo said. The activist may also consider bringing fiduciary-duty claims in the Delaware court. In recent months, Regions executives have repeatedly expressed disinterest in acquiring a bank, instead eyeing the opportunity to snag customers and talentamid disruption caused by other M&Aactivity. Regions CFO David Turner reiterated those views this month at theBancAnalysts Association of Boston conference– which would have been after the bank reportedly proposed a deal with Comerica. “We're, I think, the only bank that hadn't done an acquisition since 2006,” Turner said Nov. 7. The bank had just finished its strategic plan, “and M&A is not part of that plan,” he said. “It's just not part of where we want to focus our time and attention. And we understand things can change, but that's just not where we are today,” Turner added. Still, one analyst noted some wonder whether the bank’s position may change. “With increased M&A activity in their Southeast backyard, there have been investors who wonder if [Regions management] would start to feel compelled to take part in the M&A wave, particularly since the company is profitable but has had challenges growing organically,” Truist Securities analyst Brian Finneran wrote in a Tuesday note.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/holdco-activist-comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-regions/805807/,,
Revolut valued at $75B,"Revolut is valued at $75 billion after completing a share sale, theBritish fintech said Monday. Revolut did not disclose how many shares were sold or the amount raised. It’s the fifth share sale Revolut has allowed its staff to date, with the fintech asserting it’s “one of the most liquid employee share programmes across private companies in the industry.” The new valuation marks significant growth sinceRevolut’s $45 billion valuation 15 months ago, which came directly after it received its long-awaitedBritish banking license. Since then, Revolut has entered multiple markets,named a chairof its Western Europe arm and finalized itsbanking license in Mexico. It’s also exploring U.S. growth, with Revolut U.S. CEO Sid Jajodia saying in October thatnabbing a stateside charteris part of the firm’s growth “mission.” “The level of investor interest and our new valuation reflect the strength of our business model, which is delivering both rapid growth and strong profitability,” CFO Victor Stinga said in a prepared statement on the recent share sale. “We welcome onboard a series of world-class investors and look forward to working with them for the next stage in Revolut’s evolution.” The transaction was led by Coatue, Greenoaks, Dragoneer and Fidelity Management & Research Company. Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Andreessen Horowitz, Franklin Templeton and T. Rowe Price Associates also participated. In ablog postMonday, Coatue wrote that it sees Revolut “charting a new path.” “They are building the world’s first global financial super-app, which is now operating in 39 countries and serves over 65 million users,” wrote Brendan O’Boyle, Rohan Bharvani and Lucas Swisher, investors at Coatue, which also led Revolut’s 2024 funding round. “What began as a travel card designed to avoid high [foreign exchange] fees has evolved into a multi-product financial platform that is redefining what modern banking looks like for consumers and businesses.” Revolut’s 2024 revenue grew 72% to $4 billion year over year, with profit before tax more than doubling to $1.4 billion. Its Revolut Business arm hit $1 billion in annualized revenue in 2025, the company said. The new valuation “reflects the remarkable progress we have made in the last twelve months towards our vision of building the first truly global bank, serving 100 million customers across 100 countries,” CEO Nik Storonsky said in a prepared statement.

"Comerica, Fifth Third sued by activist investor","Just days after threatening legal action against Comerica, HoldCo Asset Management has sued the regional bank and its proposed buyer, Fifth Third. The activist investor accused Comerica CEO Curt Farmer of being “focused solely on advancing his own interests” based on the “rushed” way the Dallas-based bank’s proposed$10.9 billion acquisition by Fifth Thirdcame together. Theclass-action complaint, filed Friday in the Delaware Court of Chancery by HoldCo Opportunities Fund, alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by Comerica and its board members related to the transaction and its “draconian” provisions. It also accuses the bank of leaving out material information from disclosures related to the deal. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCo also accused Fifth Third of “aiding-and-abetting” the board in breaching its fiduciary duty. HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July, accusing the lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” In October, Fifth Third announced it would acquire Comerica. HoldCoissued a presentationlast week that picked apart the proposed deal, threatening to take Comerica to court if it didn’t release more information on how the agreement came together. Comerica rebuffed at leastone earlier suitor, Financial Institution A, according to a disclosure. That was Regions Bank, American Banker reported. The deal between Comerica and Fifth Third was “negotiated over an extraordinarily compressed timeline,” HoldCo’s Friday complaint contends. It was driven by Farmer’s “fear of an activist contest” led by HoldCo, “and his fear that no other bidder would keep him on,” the firm alleged. “Fearing for his job, Farmer raced to find a friendly white knight that could provide him with a lucrative post-closing role,” the complaint asserts. Farmer isset to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks. Part of the rush, HoldCo claims, was to avoid any proxy contest at Comerica’s annual meeting, to have been held by May 2026. The Fifth Third deal is projected to close in the first quarter of 2026. Although Comerica received an offer from Financial Institution A, the complaint alleges the Dallas bank decided to “nip those negotiations in the bud” and solely focus on Fifth Third. The deal came together hastily and in a way that ensures “no topping bid could disrupt Farmer’s entrenchment plan,” HoldCo attorneys alleged. The merger agreement carries a “gargantuan” termination fee of $500 million and “an absurdly narrow fiduciary-out” that doesn’t let the board scrap the merger for a higher bid, HoldCo said in the complaint. The “draconian” deal protections mean Comerica’s board couldn’t terminate the acquisition for a better proposal until October 2026, even if shareholders don’t vote in favor of the deal, the filing said. HoldCo also alleges the registration statement is “materially misleading and incomplete” and doesn’t provide shareholders with any details that would allow them to compare the deal’s terms with Financial Institution A’s proposed offers. “There is no evidence from the Registration Statement that Comerica ever made a counterproposal or tried to negotiate for a price above the lowest end of the exchange ratio range in Fifth Third’s initial proposal,” the complaint said. “Nor is there any evidence that Comerica made any attempt to re-engage Financial Institution A (to see if it would provide a better proposal) or solicit interest from other potential bidders.” The 17-day span – from the start of potential merger conversations between Farmer and Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence to when an agreement was signed – “is the shortest timeframe of any of the ten largest bank mergers, with the next shortest taking 43 days and the median taking 67 days,” HoldCo contended. “Such negotiations are more reminiscent of distressed bank sales during the 2008 global financial crisis,” the complaint said. In aresponse filed Monday, attorneys for Comerica argued HoldCo’s views are at odds with those of other bank shareholders, and blasted the activist for “asking this Court to deprive stockholders of a merger after agitating for just such a deal.” Fifth Third’s attorneys, in aseparate Monday filing, called HoldCo’s aiding and abetting assertion a “facially meritless claim.” “This case is only about HoldCo’s self-serving activism goals,” Fifth Third’s attorneys said. Comerica and Fifth Third attorneys accused HoldCo of “gamesmanship” and called its claims weak. Comerica’s lawyers also needled HoldCo for “revel[ing] in its notoriety” after pushing for the bank to sell itself and seeking credit for the outcome. Comerica’s attorneys also noted HoldCo was in communication with the bank’s counsel in the days leading up to filing Friday’s complaint. “At no time during those communications did HoldCo indicate it would be filing a suit to enjoin the deal on Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week,” Comerica’s attorneys said. The shareholder vote on the acquisition is tentatively scheduled for Jan. 6. A hearing was set to be held Tuesday related to a motion to expedite the case. Spokespeople for Comerica and Fifth Third declined to comment. Attorneys withBernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman, the law firm representing HoldCo, didn’t return requests for comment.

Fulton Financial to buy NJ’s Blue Foundry in $243M deal,"Fulton Financial Corp.will acquire Blue Foundry Bancorpin an all-stock transaction valued at $243 million, the companies announced Monday. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, pushes Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based Fulton into northern New Jersey. The bank gained a presence in the southern part of the state last year with itsacquisition of Republic First. The Philadelphia-based bank had locations in New Jersey and New York before it failed. Acquiring $2.15 billion-asset Blue Foundry, headquartered in Rutherford, New Jersey, gives $32 billion-asset Fulton 21 additional branches in eight counties, including four of the state’s most populous. “The expansion in northern New Jersey aligns with our strategy of growing in our local markets and positions us well to drive organic growth across our commercial, consumer, wealth advisory and mortgage businesses,” Fulton CEO Curtis Myers said in a prepared statement. “The combination of our companies creates an opportunity to leverage Fulton’s robust banking services and provide greater convenience and innovative solutions to an expanded customer base, with a continued focus on supporting our local communities,” he said. Under the terms of the agreement, Blue Foundry investors will receive 0.65 shares of Fulton common stock for each share they own. The transaction’s estimated $243 million value stems from Fulton’s $17.96 share price from Friday. “Joining forces with Fulton is an exciting step forward for our employees, customers and communities,” Blue Foundry CEO James Nesci said in a prepared statement. “This partnership allows us to preserve the local relationships and personalized service our customers value, while gaining access to greater resources and providing more solutions and convenience to customers.” In recent years, Blue Foundry has been a publicly traded bank, during which time it has reported more than $20 million in losses,American Bankerreported. Activist investor Larry Seidman, who had pushed for its sale via proxy campaign last year, told American Banker there was “no question whatsoever” that Fulton would be able to produce better results than Blue Foundry has with its assets. “It's a good bank with good management,” Seidman said of Fulton. “Blue Foundry was horrible. They couldn't make any money.” The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to tangible book value per share. It’s expected to be accretive to first full-year earnings by over 5%, and neutral to regulatory capital ratios at close. As part of the deal, Fulton will make a $1.5 million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation, which provides impact grants to nonprofit community organizations in New Jersey.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fulton-financial-to-buy-nj-blue-foundry-243m-deal/806443/,,
MoneyLion to pay $1.75M to settle CFPB lawsuit,"MoneyLion agreed Friday topay $1.75 millionto settle a long-running lawsuit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, alleging the fintech charged more than the maximum 36% interest rate allowed by the Military Lending Act on loans to service members. The settlement narrows – to 12 – the number of cases the CFPB has in active litigation, based on acount given last weekby a representative of the bureau’s workers union. The CFPB has dismissed 22 enforcement actions this year. The case also bolsters the CFPB’s commitment –from April, and subsequently reinforced in a “humility pledge” Friday – to focus on providing redress to service members, veterans and their families. As part of the settlement, MoneyLion is barred from extending consumer credit at rates higher than 36% to borrowers for whom the MLA cap applies. That includes credit insurance premiums or fees, any fee for a debt cancellation contract or debt suspension agreement, or any fee for a credit-related ancillary product sold as part of a credit transaction. It also includes finance charges, application fees or membership fees. That was a focal point of the CFPB’sSeptember 2022 lawsuitagainst the company. MoneyLion required customers to join a membership program – which carried a monthly fee between $19.99 and $29 – to access the fintech’s low annual percentage rate installment loan product, the bureau said when the suit was first filed. But the company failed to allow borrowers to cancel their memberships until their loans were paid, and in some cases, wouldn’t cancel memberships if the borrower had unpaid membership fees, the CFPB added. Friday’s settlement bars MoneyLion from preventing borrowers from canceling their membership. It also does not permit the fintech to engage in collections activities for past unpaid membership fees, collecting membership fees for periods when memberships were suspended. MoneyLion also can’t prevent borrowers from paying off loans in full by using funds in their credit reserve account, according to the settlement. Nor can the company ding borrowers’ credit scores over unpaid membership fees. Also as part of the settlement, MoneyLion must submit an accurate written compliance report, sworn under penalty of perjury, to the CFPB, detailing the number of borrowers who received redress and the amount paid to each. The settlement covers borrowers who had outstanding MoneyLion loans between December 2017 and October 2024. MoneyLion, in September 2022, disputed the CFPB’s allegations, accusing the regulator of taking a “sensationalist route of prioritizing headlines instead of engaging in constructive dialogue.” “MoneyLion has the highest regard for its military and veteran customers and [is] committed to working with this important community to help them achieve better financial health,” the company said at the time. “MoneyLion is honored to serve this important segment of its customer base and is grateful for the sacrifice these men and women have made for our country.” The membership offering represents a small subset of MoneyLion’s business, the company said at the time. Since then, the fintech has come under new management: MoneyLionwas acquired this yearby Gen Digital forabout $1 billion. The CFPB is also not the only entity with a consumer-protection case against MoneyLion.New York’s attorney generalsued MoneyLion and fellow earned wage access provider DailyPay in April, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to tens of thousands of workers with fees that “amount to outrageous annual interest rates in the triple digits.” Thecity of Baltimorelast month sued MoneyLion, alleging the company misled and manipulated consumers into taking out small-dollar, short-term loans that come with high fees. MoneyLion in 2023 persuaded the judge in the CFPB case topause proceedingsahead of aSupreme Court rulingthat affirmed the bureau’s funding structure is constitutional.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-moneylion-settlement-mla-interest-rate-36-cap-military-membership-fees/806439/,,
U.S. Bank hires up for greater Southeast growth,"After adding bankers to serve businesses in Dallas and Houston, U.S. Bank is now focused on further expansion across the Southeast, a business banking executive said. Within the next six months, U.S. Bank plans to hire at least a dozen bankers in a couple of Southeast states where it doesn’t have branches, said Dee O’Dell, head of business banking sales at the Minneapolis-based lender. He didn’t elaborate, butthat group includesAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. The super-regional bank has recently added teams of bankers in markets where it’s seeing greater growth opportunity, including a second team in Charlotte, North Carolina; a second in Las Vegas; and a fourth in Chicago, O’Dell said during a recent interview. In his unit, about 250 people have been hired into new roles this year. In Houston, where the $695 billion-asset bank announced last week it added a business banking team, four people have been hired and the lender plans to bring on two more, he said. In U.S. Bank’s business banking segment, which serves companies generating between $2.5 million to $50 million in annual revenue, about 1,200 employees across the country serve about 75,000 clients, O’Dell said. The consumer and business banking segmentmakes up about 32%of the lender’s overall revenue, which was $21.3 billion year to date,as of Sept. 30. U.S. Bank provides those commercial clients with different types of credit for their capital needs, including conventional financing, owner-occupied real estate loans and Small Business Administration loans. Clients in that size range often “not only have their primary business, but they're looking for ways to diversify,” O’Dell said. “They not only want to own the building they're in, they may want to own some other buildings as well, and so we've got the ability to provide capital for them, not only for their core business, but for investment real estate.” Bankers also seek to connect clients with other U.S. Bank services, such as credit cards, merchant processing, treasury management, foreign exchange and wealth management. Amid a highly competitive landscape, the lender has sharpened efforts to offer anddeliver services to clientsin a comprehensive way, O’Dell said. “Our approach has been to integrate all that together so that there is value that comes from having all of that in one place,” he said. To zero in on where businesses could gain the most benefit, the bank developed – along with a fintech O’Dell wouldn’t name – a proprietary diagnostic tool for companies. The questionnaire assesses business needs and money movement, diagnoses the level of efficiency in those functions and has a team review results with business clients. “The idea is that instead of trying to sell any one of those products, we're approaching it in a much more consultative and holistic way,” O’Dell said. “It helps our clients see how they can be even more efficient, save time in their day, eliminate risk of fraud, other things like that.” That diagnostic effort has bolstered the bank’s success rate in serving new clients since it was introduced nearly two years ago, O’Dell said. “Sometimes our bankers will meet with a company that we don't bank with today. And if your question is, ‘Do you need any banking services?’ The answer might be, ‘No, no, everything's fine. It's all good,’” O’Dell said. “If we can get them to engage with us and have this conversation and fill out this basic template questionnaire, we can go back and provide insights. And often, it opens up a conversation where companies don't even realize the things that they are doing or not doing that could lead to so much greater efficiency.” Another newer internal tool aggregates data to give bankers a view of companies or prospects within the markets they serve, allowing them to sort by sales size, industry type or ownership of property, so they can better target clients based on potential needs, O’Dell said. SBA loans may be a prime option for some of those businesses and that’s an area of lending U.S. Bank seeks to grow further, since it can serve as a company’s entry point into the bank. U.S. Bank has doubled its SBA lending in the past two years, O’Dell said. In fiscal 2025, the bank totaled $871.2 million in SBA 7(a) loans, up 23% from the previous fiscal year,it said last month. “We've been able to use that program to help a number of companies, individuals get capital they wouldn't otherwise be able to get, and because of the way that we approach that, and our client selection in that, the loss ratio that we've had in that space has been very attractive to our shareholders,” O’Dell said. SBA lending can be ideal in some succession situations, O’Dell noted. The segment of businesses O’Dell oversees has a significant number of owners nearing the end of their careers, so the bank also aims to jump on the chance to be involved in those moments. In cases where a business owner doesn’t have a child who wants to take over, they may look to sell to a similar company or private equity firm. Or if there’s someone in the company who’s interested in acquiring it but doesn’t have the capital, the bank can use an SBA loan to help with that pursuit. “We see great opportunities to help the next generation of business owners acquire business and a current generation who are at the end of their careers, exit, monetize what they've invested in, and have this sense that their legacy will continue,” O’Dell said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/us-bank-adding-business-bankers-southeast-odell/806212/,,
VALT Bank applies for de novo charter,"A group of former U.S. Bank executives is seeking federal approval to establish VALT Bank, applications submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Nov. 13 show. The proposed bank, headquartered in Eagle, Idaho, will be fully digital and will focus on serving “digitally demanding small to midsized businesses” in the U.S., according to its application. VALT plans to offer credit and deposit products as well as treasury and cash management services, and plans to provide clients with SMB-focused automation solutions. The bank will be led by proposed director, CEO and President Matt Gediman, whose nearly two-decade U.S. Bank career culminated in three years as a managing director in the bank’s private wealth management business. “When we refer to ‘digitally demanding SMBs,’ we mean revenue-generating small and midsized businesses that use technology across their daily operations and expect the same level of technological fluency from their financial service providers,” Gediman told Banking Dive via email Monday. These are traditional businesses, he added – not tech firms or crypto companies. VALT does not plan to interact with digital assets. “Our customers are established SMBs that simply expect modern, reliable, integrated digital banking,” he said. “[O]ur model is designed to support them by making banking uncomplicated, accessible, and integrated with digital tools to run their businesses more efficiently,” he said. Former U.S. Bank Vice Chairman John Elmore is VALT’s proposed executive chair and Ross Carey, former U.S. Bank EVP of business banking and SBA division, is its proposed vice chair. Kim Hoyt, attorney at Salem, Oregon-based law firm Garrett Hemann Robertson, and Dana Johnson, president and chief investment officer at single-family office MidAmerica Capital Partners, are VALT’s additional proposed directors. The OCC declined to comment on the application, and the FDIC did not respond immediately to a request for comment. But the heads of both agencies have recently spoken in favor of increased de novo chartering. Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gouldtold Banking Dive last monththat one of his major goals while at the helm of the OCC is “invigorating de novo chartering in America.” Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hillnoted earlier this year that new bank formationhas “fallen off a cliff” in recent years. At the American Bankers Association’s Washington Summit in April, he noted that 412 new banks were formed in 1984 alone, and that the lowest number of new banks established in any year between 1995 and 2007 was 93. By comparison, just 86 new banks have been formed since 2010, Hill said, and more than half of them came between 2019 and 2022 when Trump appointee Jelena McWilliams ran the FDIC. The OCC and the FDIC have received a number of bank applications since President Donald Trump took office again in January. Applicants includingCoinbaseandStripe-owned Bridgeseek national trust charters, which do not allow for lending or taking insured deposits. One bank – Erebor Bank, which applied for a de novo charter in June – has received conditional approval under Gould’s leadership. Its conditional approval wasgranted in October. TheOCC leasing manualindicates that the agency should make decisions on a charter application within 120 days of receiving it, lining VALT up for an answer by mid-March. Gediman, for VALT’s part, said the team’s intention is to “build a safe, well-governed institution that meets the needs of modern business owners through a unique digital-first experience.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/valt-bank-applies-for-de-novo-charter/806295/,,
CFPB can’t ignore judge’s order: workers union,"Lawyers for a workers unionurged a federal courtSunday to clarify apreliminary injunctionto ensure that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau leaders don’t shutter the agency by refusing funding. “The defendants have filed a ‘notice’ announcing that they intend to allow the Bureau to run out of funding, and when it does, they will stop complying with the Court’s injunction,” attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union wrote Sunday. “Parties may not simply declare that an injunction no longer applies.” The CFPB this monthalertedthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it “anticipates exhausting its currently available funds in early 2026.” At issue is the definition of “combined earnings.” The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel sent a memo to CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought on Nov. 7, asserting that it interprets earnings – from which the Federal Reserve derives the CFPB’s operating budget – as profit rather than revenue. By that math, the Fed has operated at a loss since 2022. NTEU attorneys asserted Sunday that the Fed earns “billions of dollars a year – from interest on loans and securities, and fees assessed” on banks. But because the Fed has raised interest rates since 2022, its combined interest expenses have exceeded combined earnings. The plaintiffs cite congressional testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told lawmakers the central bank examined that balance “very carefully” and concluded the law is “very clear” that the Fed must fund the CFPB even when its expenses exceed its earnings. Further, NTEU attorneys said, the OLC memo “admits, nobody – not any court, not the Fed, and not the CFPB – has ever interpreted” combined earnings as it suggested this month. “Both the Fed and the CFPB (until Vought needed a mechanism to circumvent this Court’s injunction) have consistently understood ‘combined earnings’ to mean, simply, everything the Fed earns,” NTEU attorneys wrote. The OLC’s interpretation relies on “technical definitions from corporate accounting,” NTEU attorneys wrote. “But the Fed is not a private corporation. It sets monetary policy for the United States. … The only reason to adopt its reading of ‘combined earnings’ is to shut down the CFPB.” Vought, in an appearance last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” indeed said of the CFPB: “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within thenext two, three months.” The bureau last week indicated it istransferring all of its active litigationto the DOJ. By the OLC’s logic, NTEU attorneys wrote, Congress would have passed a Dodd-Frank Act “that forces the Federal Reserve Board to choose between increasing interest rates to combat inflation and funding the CFPB.” “Fortunately, that is not the law that Congress wrote,” the attorneys asserted, blasting the CFPB for not choosing another path. “Rather than asking this Court to modify its injunction (which would require them to demonstrate that it should), the defendants have chosen to just ‘inform’ the Court that they ‘do not understand’ the injunction to bind them once the CFPB runs out of money – even if that’s because they decided not to ask the Fed for funding,” NTEU attorneys wrote. Outside of the courtroom, the CFPB on Friday issued what it termed a “humility pledge” meant to be read aloud by bank examiners to banks before exams. The statement drills down on the bureau’snarrowing of focustoward consumer threats that harm service members, veterans and their families and reiterates that the bureau will “avoid, where possible, duplication of supervision, where States or other regulators are already doing that job.” The bureau pledges shorter examination times – reduced from eight weeks to a period “commensurate with the defined scope of exams.” “No longer will the Bureau ask for expansive data sets or other information which may seem unrelated to the exam or include information inconsistent with Bureau priorities,” the pledge reads. “Any follow-up requests by examiners will first be discussed with an entity and will be tailored to the scope of the exam and the information already received from the entity.” The CFPB states its goal as “[to] work collaboratively with the entities to review entities’ processes for compliance and/or remedy existing problems,” emphasizing self-reporting and encouraging banks to resolve issues with the CFPB’s supervision unit, rather than enforcement. That may lend credence to a narrative, from an all-hands meeting of enforcement staff, in which the bureau’s acting enforcement chief said all 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation at the end of the year. Curiously, perhaps, the pledge encourages banks, if they find their exam experience to be “inconsistent with these principles,” to reach out via email to a designated CFPB supervisory official or the bureau’s chief legal officer. In apost Monday on the NTEU’s website, union member Alexis Goldstein asked, “Why is Russell Vought showing the world his weird, creepy pledge of allegiance to big corporations?” Another union member, Doug Wilson, notes a passage in the pledge in which the bureau asserts that examiners will be “encouraged and incentivized to complete the work promptly and under budget.” “This memo doesn't add up,” Wilson wrote. “Vought’s stopped all supervision exams in 2025, refuses to fund CFPB and says he’s shutting us down by 2026. So how will we supervise banks in 2026 if CFPB is closed? How can bank exams be ‘under budget’ if there is no budget?” In an emailed press release to accompany the humility pledge, the CFPB characterized the bureau’s Biden-era supervision efforts as “thuggery,” calling out ex-supervision chief LoreleiSalas as “a former [Democratic donor George] Soros activist who wasput on leave in February 2025.” Further, bureau leadership labeled the pre-Trump supervision unit as “a weaponized arm of the CFPB.” In aLinkedIn post, Allison Preiss, who until February served as senior adviser to the CFPB director, said the humility pledge “might be better characterized as a humiliation pledge.” “The notion that federal employees should genuflect, trembling, before a Wells Fargo or Bank of America, is some of the most ridiculous nonsense I've read all week,” she wrote. In anotherLinkedIn post, Tyler Creighton, counsel at the CFPB, took issue with the idea that the bureau is calling out examiners’ past conduct. “Supervision's workers have always conducted examinations professionally, efficiently, conscientiously, and with a focus on remedying consumer harm,” he wrote. “We will continue to do so, just as soon as Donald Trump and Russell Vought end the nearly 10-month suspension of examinations and let us get back to work for the American people.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-humility-pledge-supervision-enforcement-bank-examiners-fed-funding-refuse-vought-court/806314/,,
Stripe faces bank charter pushback,"A national trust banking charter would let the digital payments giant Stripe offer banking services while sidestepping certain regulations, an advocacy organization opposingthe payment provider's charter applicationargued in a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency this month. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition alsosaid in the letterthat the charter would give Stripe legitimacy that it does not deserve, pointing to the fintech’s history of legal trouble. Stripe, whichacquired a stablecoin infrastructure companycalled Bridge this year, proposes to name the bank Bridge National Trust. “The OCC must reject Stripe’s application for a national trust bank charter due to serious concerns regarding Stripe’s disregard for enforcement, governance, compliance, and consumer protection laws,” according to the Nov. 13 letter, which is addressed to Sebastian Astrada, the agency’s director for licensing of novel banks. The NCRC is a coalition of hundreds of U.S. community-based organizations which run the gamut from faith-based nonprofits to social justice advocates. The organization posted the letter on its website last week. Bridgeapplied for the charter in October. The charter would give Bridge and its parent company the right to provide custody, stablecoin issuance, and management of stablecoin reserves within a federal framework, rather than through state-to-state money transmitter licenses. Spokespeople for Stripe did not respond to messages seeking comment about the NCRC’s letter. If the charter is approved, Bridge would form the Bridge National Trust Bank, to be headquartered in New York City, according tothe Oct. 14 application. CEO Patrick Collison co-founded Stripe along with his brother John Collison, who is president of the business. “We’ve long believed stablecoins will be a core, regulated building block,” Bridge co-founder Zach Abrams wroteon the social media platform Xlast month. “This regulatory infrastructure will enable us to tokenize trillions of dollars and make this future possible.” The crypto firmsCircle,Paxos,RippleandCoinbasehave also applied for charters through the OCC, although none of those applications has been approved yet. With the trust, Stripe could also facilitate payments without supervision from the Federal Reserve, the NCRC said in its letter. “Granting these firms limited purpose trust charters would blur the statutory boundaries of what constitutes a bank, undermine the credibility of the national charter, and heighten systemic risk by allowing them to operate under a lighter regulatory regime,” the group wrote. The coalition also outlines some of the lawsuits and legal action taken against Stripe. In 2020, for example, the Massachusetts attorney general found Stripe had facilitated payments for a fraudulent cryptocurrency operation due to subpar risk monitoring and fraud prevention systems. The companyagreed to pay $120,000and improve its fraud control and employee training. The letter also lists several lawsuits against the company alleging, among other things, that Stripe failed to ensure customer privacy and protect customer data.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/stripe-faces-bank-charter-pushback/806315/,,
How the open banking rule skidded,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said this month it cannot draw funding to continue operations when its current funds lapse, presenting the agency a number of challenges in formulating an open banking rule quickly. The CFPBtold a federal courtNov. 11 that the Justice Department had concluded that the bureau cannot “lawfully draw funds” from the Federal Reserve System – which Congress designated as its funding source – and that the agency has funds to operate until year’s end. The bureau’s notice did not specify what would happen then, although the CFPB’s acting director, Russ Vought, has assailed the agency in the past and spoke publicly in October about itsclosure within months. The bureau has been working on a new open banking rule since July, when it told a federal court it would “substantially”revise the ruleand was granted a litigation stay of a lawsuitfiled last yearby banking trade groups. The CFPB did not respond to an email Monday seeking comment on the rule. Last week, the bureau notified employees that it wouldtransfer its litigation workto the DOJ and planned additional furloughs at year’s end. In its motion for a stay, the bureau told U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves it planned “an accelerated rulemaking process” to address what it considered to be deficiencies with the prior rule, enacted under the Biden administration. But any proposed rule with significant changes – such as allowing financial institutions to charge fees for access to customers’ data – would also require the bureau to assess the impacts to small businesses under the federal Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, attorneys noted. At that point, a public comment period on the proposed rule – typically 30 to 90 days – would begin. The CFPB would then consider those comments and issue a final rule. However, the bureau is considering skipping some parts of the rulemaking process to issue a rule by year’s end, potentially including a public comment period on its proposed rule,Bloomberg Law reportedThursday, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. “Given the polarized view of these rules by the banking and FinTech sectors, if either constituency objects to the substance of the CFPB’s revisions, additional litigation could ensue,” an attorney with law firm McGlinchey Stafford, Adam Maarec, wrote in a Septemberalertabout the process. “An ‘accelerated rulemaking’ still takes a long time,” added Maarec, who advises fintechs and banks. The prior rule took CFPB staff four years from the rulemaking notice to a final rule, he noted, adding “the scope of issues here seems significantly narrower.” Banking groups that sued the bureau last year leaned heavily on the Administrative Procedure Act for their complaint, arguing that the agency had overstepped its authority to impose “a complicated, costly, and fundamentally insecure mandatory data-sharing framework” that did not allow banks to recover their costs. Last month, Reeves issued apreliminary injunctionpreventing the bureau from enforcing its rule, pending the revised rule the CFPB is formulating. A spokesperson for the Bank Policy Institute said Monday the organization understands that the bureau’s rulemaking process is moving forward but declined to comment further, directing other queries to the agency. The Financial Data and Technology Association, which counts data aggregators Plaid and Yodlee as members, said it continues to oppose any effort allowing banks to impose fees for customer data. Both Plaid and Yodlee have announced agreements with the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase, in the past two months that include new fees for data access. The Dodd-Frank Act does not permit fees, which are “a competitive toll on consumers simply for exercising their right to access and share their own financial information,” FDATA Executive Director Steve Boms said Monday in an emailed statement. “If banks are given the green light to impose those fees in a new rule, it would fundamentally shift control of financial data away from consumers and toward already powerful incumbents.” A spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association declined to comment Friday on the CFPB’s future or rule process, as did the American Fintech Council on Monday. Vought, who also leads the Office of Management and Budget, has been trying todramatically downsizethe CFPB’s workforce and mission since he was appointed acting director in February. “We don’t have anyone working there except our Republican appointees and a few career [employees] that are doing statutory responsibilities while weclose down the agency,” Vought said last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months.” Conservative lawmakers and interest groups have targeted the bureau since Congress formed it 15 years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. “The CFPB is a highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency. It is unconstitutional,” the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote in its “Project 2025Mandate for Leadership” document, in a chapter written by Robert Bowes, ahousing department officialin the first Trump administration and a former Chase Manhattan banking executive. “The next conservative President should order the immediate dissolution of the agency — pull down its prior rules, regulations and guidance, return its staff to their prior agencies and its building to the General Services Administration.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-open-banking-rule-skidded-fintechs-banks-vought-court/806436/,,
Ex-Truist employee sentenced in ‘complex’ check-cashing scheme,"A former Truist branch employee is one of eight Georgia residents sentenced in a counterfeit check-cashing scheme that involved stolen check information, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgiasaid Wednesday. The “complex” check-cashing and kickback scheme ran from at least November 2021 to December 2022, prosecutors said. At the time, Mariarlene Brown, aka “Mati Mom,” 44, of Valdosta, worked at a Truist branch in that city. In conspiring with Brown and others to commit bank fraud, William Allen Roberts, 27, of Valdosta, unlawfully obtained check information from Vincent Galliard, 41, of Sumter, South Carolina. Galliard was a former U.S. Postal Service employee in South Carolina who sold checks he stole from the mail, prosecutors said. Roberts used the check information provided by Galliard to produce fraudulent checks. Six others involved in the scheme recruited people to open Truist bank accounts and then got those people to provide their new Truist debit card and account information to those behind the scheme, “with the understanding that they would be paid for doing so,” prosecutors said. That group of co-conspirators included Frederick Pernell Green, 27; Thomas Christopher Mitchell, 31; Calvin Dewayne McKeithen, aka “Supa,” 26; Dewayne Rasheen Butler, aka “Guwapo,” 26; Tyler Khershad Jones, aka “LA Clippers,” 24; and Davontay Wiseman, aka “Vonn,” 28. Those six then passed the account information on to Roberts, who would write checks to those individuals in various amounts. Roberts, with Brown’s help, deposited checks into those accounts, and Brown made sure Roberts could withdraw cash from the accounts, according to prosecutors. Roberts paid Brown for her help in the scheme, as well as the co-conspirators and account holders, prosecutors said. Green, Roberts, Mitchell, McKeithen, Jones, Butler and Wiseman kept most of each check that was deposited, prosecutors said. Text messages the group members exchanged described the conspiracy, and investigators also discovered photos of debit cards, account numbers, fraudulent checks, cash obtained from the check deposits “and a custom-made diamond ring in the shape of the Truist logo worn by Green,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Brown was sentenced to 33 months in prison, five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $390,475.84 in restitution to Truist on Oct. 9, after she pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Seven others – all except Galliard – also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, were sentenced to prison time and ordered to pay Truist restitution in the same amount. Galliard pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a South Carolina case and was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison, along with five years of supervised release, prosecutors said. Galliard was ordered to pay $149,692.14 in restitution divided among The Citizens Bank, First Citizens Bank, South Atlantic Bank, TD Bank, The Conway National Bank and Bank of America, according toa court filing. “Individuals who participate in check-cashing and kickback schemes will face imprisonment and other penalties,” U.S. Attorney Will Keyes said in the press release. “Investigators from the Secret Service and the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office worked to unravel this criminal network, ultimately preventing further theft and helping us ensure accountability for the defendants.” Bank regulators seek to bolster their efforts to address check fraud, which has grown “substantially” in the past several years, Michelle Bowman, the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision,said in June. Although check use has dropped, check fraud hasn’t diminished in tandem. “Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of real or attempted check fraud transactions grew nearly fourfold, even as the number of checks paid fell by more than 18 percent from 2018 to 2021,”the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantareported this year.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ex-truist-employee-sentenced-check-cashing-scheme/806169/,,
Citi CFO Mark Mason to step down in March,"Citi CFO Mark Mason, arguably the highest-profile Black executive at a U.S.-based global systemically important financial institution, will step down from his role in early March, the bankannounced Thursday. At that point, Gonzalo Luchetti, now the bank’s head of U.S. personal banking, will become CFO. Mason, meanwhile, will transition to executive vice chair and senior executive adviser to Citi CEO Jane Fraser, but he intends to pursue leadership opportunities outside the bank by the end of 2026, according to the announcement. In his adviser role, Mason will help Citi prepare for its investor day May 7 and give guidance on the bank’s strategic initiatives. Mason has been a key figure in Citi’stwo-year reorganization, in which the bank set out to simplify its structure,trim its headcount by 20,000employees by 2026, and embrace tech modernization meant to free it fromtwo 2020 consent orders. Citi launched further reorganization Thursday, saying it would integrate its retail bank into its wealth business. The move arguably hands more responsibility to wealth chief Andy Sieg. The bank’s U.S. Everyday Banking, Citi Priority, Citigold and Citigold Private Client labels will be consolidated into a single group led by Kate Luft. Luft, who has served as head of U.S. retail bankingsince April, will add “and Citigold” to her title and report to Sieg. With the move, “U.S. Personal Banking” will no longer be one of Citi’s five core businesses, the company said. But it will be replaced by “U.S. Consumer Cards,” which will combine the bank’s branded cards and retail services businesses under Pam Habner. Habner, who has served as Citi’s head of branded cards and lendingsince 2020, will join the bank’s executive management team and report directly to Fraser. “This evolution of our leadership team and structure is well timed as it puts in place our next generation of leaders ahead of our upcoming Investor Day, when we will lay out our plans to further grow our returns,” Fraser said Thursday in a statement. “We are ending the year with momentum and confidence.” Mason’s upcoming transition comes less than a month after Citi threw added support behind Fraser,naming her chairand giving her a $25 million equity award meant to keep her in place for years to come. Fraser on Thursday called Mason “an invaluable partner” who “models integrity, drive and commitment no matter the circumstances, and has always put the firm first.” “Mark has proven himself to be a leader for all seasons, having helped Citi navigate some of our most challenging times and being a driving force behind the results we are now seeing in our performance and our Transformation,” Fraser said, citing the capitalized term the bank gives its tech modernization. Mason joined Citi in 2001 and has been CFO since 2019 – but between those benchmarks has served as CEO of Citi’s private bank, CEO of Citi Holdings, and CFO of the bank’s Institutional Clients Group, according to hisLinkedIn profile. “Serving as CFO for the last seven years and contributing to a leadership team that is redefining expectations for Citi stands as one of the most demanding and fulfilling chapters of my career,” Mason said in a statement Thursday. “I know that Gonzalo will work tirelessly with the strong team we’ve built across Finance to further Citi’s momentum, and I am fully committed to his smooth transition into the new role.” Scott Siefers, a managing director and senior research analyst for Piper Sandler, called Mason’s departure “an unfortunate loss” for Citi. “Thankfully, he will be succeeded by an insider with deep experience,” Siefers wrote in a note seen by Banking Dive. Luchetti joined Citi in 2006 and has served, among other roles, as consumer banking chief for Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and as global head of wealth management and insurance, according to hisLinkedIn profile. He became head of U.S. personal banking in 2021 and on Thursday earned plaudits from Fraser for expanding his segment’s return on tangible common equity to 14.5% for 2025’s third quarter. “I knew exactly what we needed in our next CFO to build on Mark’s successful tenure,” Fraser said. “In addition to the table-stakes requirement of superb financial acumen, it must be someone who is strategically minded, data-driven, analytical, and an excellent operator. … Gonzalo is that person.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-mark-mason-cfo-step-down-march-gonzalo-luchetti-fraser-sieg-luft-habner/806137/,,
Wells Fargo taps Saul Van Beurden to scale AI,"Saul Van Beurden, chief executive of Wells Fargo consumer and small business banking,has been tappedto scale artificial intelligence at the bank, the lender said Thursday. Additionally, the bank’s CEO for consumer lending, Kleber Santos, will take on added responsibilities as co-CEO of consumer lending and banking as Wells formally combines the businesses, allowing Van Beurden to focus more on AI. “Generative and agentic AI will reshape competitive dynamics across every industry, and we are embracing these tools as we have embraced robotic process automation and machine learning for years,” Wells CEO Charlie Scharf said in a prepared statement. In August, Wells gave branch bankers, investment bankers, customer relations and corporate teamsaccess to AI agents and toolsfrom Google Cloud. The tools help employees sort through massive loads of documentation and provide real-time market insights, among other things. Wells is among banks in a near-ubiquitous industry pushtoward AI-fueled efficiencies. Wells has trained some 90,000 employees on AI this year, deployed AI tools to many others and is now broadening its uses, Scharf said. “Our employees and customers have powerful models in their hands. They expect the same at work,” Van Beurden toldForbesthis month on AI. “GenAI helps remove simple repetitive tasks, builds workflows and frees people to do higher-value work. We are scratching the surface.” The key is to deploy AI in ways that “enhance human performance rather than replace it,” he told Forbes. In his enhanced role, Van Beurden will help leaders in Wells’ businesses oversee transformation in their own segments, Scharf said in a prepared statement. “Success will be driven by business heads embracing these new technologies and rethinking their own operating models using generative and agentic AI solutions,” Scharf said. The advances in AI, he added, “have given us a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform how we work and we are excited by what we can deliver for our employees, customers and communities.” Van Beurden joined Wells in2019 from JPMorgan Chase, where he was chief information officer of consumer and community banking.

CFPB is transferring its cases to DOJ,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is transferring all of its active litigation to the Justice Department, according to separate statements Thursday from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, and the workers union representing the agency. Further, Mike Salemi, the CFPB’s acting enforcement chief, said at an all-hands meeting Thursday that, as he understood it, all bureau employees would be furloughed at the end of the year,Government Executivereported, citing people familiar with the matter. Salemi hedged, saying he was not privy to all of the plans, but that the information came from an associate general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget who also serves as a senior legal adviser at the CFPB. The timeline, if true, would dovetail with a projection CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought made in a podcast appearance last month, when he said the only employees left at the bureau were “our Republican appointees and a few career [staff] that are doing statutory responsibilities while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the nexttwo, three months,” Vought said. Further, DOJ attorneys filed paperwork last week with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, indicating the CFPB “anticipates exhaustingits currently available funds in early 2026.” The filing was meant to flag a “potential lapse in appropriations” to pay the bureau’s operating expenses. The court this year granted apreliminary injunctionpreventing the CFPB from firing the vast majority of its staff. Included in the filing was a memo the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel sent Vought, asserting that the bureau may not legally request funds at this time from the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. Salemi on Thursday said the 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation, according to Government Executive. A few top officials may have the opportunity to work for DOJ,American Bankerreported, citing people who were part of the all-hands call. Salemi noted that the DOJ stood up an enforcement and affirmative litigation unit within its Civil Division in September. Salemi told CFPB staff he assumed the agency’s work would be routed there beginning in 2026, according to Government Executive. Cat Farman, president of the National Treasury Employees Union 335, which represents CFPB employees, said Vought has “no legal authority” to transfer the bureau’s cases to the DOJ. “This is Russ Vought’s latest illegal power grab in his ongoing plan to shut down the CFPB,” Farman said in a statement on theNTEU’s website. However, the Dodd-Frank Act indicates the DOJ has the authority to handle cases where no agency is designated to do so by law,Bloomberg Lawreported. Before the CFPB was established in 2011, the DOJ took cases under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act because no other agency had the power. The CFPB is still litigating 13 cases, Farman said, though Vought this year has dismissed 22 enforcement actions brought by the bureau under previous administrations. “CFPB attorneys are afraid DOJ will dismiss [the remaining] cases,” Farman said. The DOJ declined to comment. The CFPB didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Warren, the senator credited as the architect of the bureau, appeared to hold tight to her suspicions. “Donald Trump and Russ Vought are racing to shut down the CFPB while their lawyers tell the courts the opposite,”Warren wrotein a statement Thursday. “Nobody is fooled about the Trump-Vought end game, and the courts must uphold the law.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-transfer-litigation-doj-enforcement-furloughs-salemi-vought/806193/,,
"TD illegally targeted, fired Chinese-heritage employees: lawsuit","Five former TD Bank employees of Chinese heritage say the bank illegally fired them in the wake of TD’s fentanyl-tied money laundering scandal,court documents show. Plaintiffs Andrew Wong, Ka Po Wong, Anne Louie, April Ng and Millie Su allege that TD “intentionally targeted and disproportionately impacted the bank’s Chinese and Chinese American employees” to placate investigators as they probed the lender’santi-money laundering control issues, and to “give the appearance of robust AML procedures.” The bank’s “robust enforcement” went “far beyond the normal scope” in investigating the employees’ personal transaction histories, particularly cash exchanges that moved through their bank accounts, the plaintiffs said. Chinese families traditionally borrow money from family and friends, rather than banks, and it’s common for family members to gift funds for large purchases, such as a house, plaintiffs said, citing a “financial culture [that] is prevalent in the Chinese diaspora, including the Chinese-American community.” The investigators did not take that into account, the plaintiffs asserted. In one instance, investigators pressed Ng on a $500 transaction in new bills meant as a gift during Chinese New Year, a custom. In another, investigators questioned Su about $15,000 in cash she received from family members. The funds, intended as a house down payment gift to a family associate, were deposited into Su’s account. She added $5,000 from her account, and wrote the associate a $20,000 check. “The targeted Chinese and Chinese American employees provided proof that transactions questioned by TD were legitimate, yet each still suffered the most severe adverse employment action possible. They were terminated,” plaintiffs allege. “More callously, the terminated Chinese and Chinese American were demarketed from TD Bank. TD closed their personal and business accounts, and, upon information and belief, barred them from banking with TD in the future.” Prior to the fentanyl-tied AML investigation, TD “leveraged the national origin of its Chinese and Chinese American employees to foster trust in the Chinese community and build their business,” plaintiffs said. During the investigation, however, TD’s Chinese and Chinese American employees “were then targeted by the bank because of their ethnicity and national origin. They were punished for crimes committed by other Chinese individuals — crimes they were not involved in by individuals they did not know.” “Their Chinese heritage, once used by TD Bank to garner trust in the Chinese community, now became a target for TD,” plaintiffs said. Due to TD’s investigations of its Chinese and Chinese American employees in the New York City’s Chinatown branches alone, at least 22 employees were terminated or subject to adverse employment actions, the lawsuit asserted. All but one of the terminated employees were of Chinese origin. At least one employee was terminated for a transaction with a Chinese American employee, according to court documents. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement at their respective jobs, back pay and emotional damages sustained as a result of TD’s conduct. A TD spokesperson told Banking Dive that the bank has no comment, given that the litigation is pending. Arthur Schwartz, an attorney for the plaintiffs, did not respond to a request for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/td-illegally-targeted-fired-chinese-heritage-employees-lawsuit/806066/,,

Capital One joins FedNow,"Capital One joined the Federal Reserve’s instant payments system FedNow this week, leaving Bank of America and Truist among the major U.S. financial institutions not participating in that real-time ecosystem. Capital One started its FedNow participation Tuesday, a spokesperson for the bank said by email. “Financial Institutions of all sizes are rapidly enabling instant payments for their accountholders,” U.S. Faster Payments Council CEO Reed Luhtanen said by email, when asked for comment on how the system is developing. “The ability to offer instant money movement is becoming table stakes in our 21st century economy, and financial institutions that don’t have a faster payments strategy need to develop one, and fast.” A spokesperson for Bank of America didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson confirmed late last month that the bank had not yet joined FedNow. FedNow has attracted all but two of theeight biggest U.S. retail banks, according to a list of participants on theFederal Reserve’s FedNow website. The service allows for the transfer of payments between banks in seconds or minutes, as opposed to some alternatives that take days. While about 1,550 U.S. financial institutions have joined the FedNow system since itlaunched in July 2023, there are thousands that have not, despite the central bank’s efforts to attract smaller banks as well. In all, there are about 9,000 U.S. financial institutions, including large banks, smaller regional and community banks, and credit unions. (Only U.S. financial institutions are allowed to connect to the FedNow system.) Nonetheless, the large banks are the most active in the payments sphere. The 50 biggest banks operating in the U.S. account for more than 90% of payment originations on the major clearing systems operated by The Clearing House andNacha, based on those organizations’ statistics. To smooth the way to joining the system, the Fed is trying to make it as easy as possible. Currently, the “record” time period for onboarding a bank — from signing a contract with the central bank to offering services — is seven days, FedNow Chief Executive Nick Stanescusaid in a video poston FedNow’s website Tuesday. He noted there are also 41 certified service providers that aid in bringing bank clients to the system. To boost transaction volume, FedNow has been gradually increasing the maximum amount that can be sent over the system.

Lloyds to buy UK fintech Curve,"London-based Lloyds Bank will buy theU.K. fintech Curve, the bankannounced Wednesday. Lloyds did not disclose the price point for the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2026. But the acquisition lends credence to aSky Newsreport from last week, indicating the bank would pay £120 million for the digital wallet provider. That’s less than half the £250 million in funding Curve is said to have raised since its founding in 2015. And it’s far below the valuation CEO Shachar Bialick had targeted for the company. “In ten years’ time we are going to be IPO-ed … and hopefully worth around $50 billion to $60 billion,” Bialick, a former Israeli special forces soldier, toldThe Times of Londonin 2019, using the acronym for initial public offering. In a circular to investors last week, Curve said it “share[s] the disappointment some of you may have in this outcome.” “We recognize that the value of this transaction falls short of the ambitions we all held for Curve,” the company said in the note, seen by Sky News. “Yet, the board strongly believes this transaction represents the best available path forward for Curve's creditors and shareholders as a whole."" However, IDC Ventures, an investor that holds a 12% stake in Curve, said in a statement Friday it is ""deeply concerned about the conduct of Curve's management and board during the current sale process."" IDC alleged a small group of directors and investors at Curve “facilitated corporate decision-making to entrench control and override shareholder rights,” adding that “issues regarding [Curve’s] governance and ownership are disputed.” The investor sought toremove Curve's chairin September, but the effort failed. IDC has consistently opposed a sale to Lloyds since rumors of a potential transaction became public in July. The investor wrote “repeatedly” to Curve and its board, opposing the sale, “without receiving any meaningful response or engagement,” it asserted in September. IDC also said it wrote to Lloyds, but the bank did not respond. “It is a matter of real surprise to shareholders that Lloyds Banking Group, a leading UK institution, would contemplate proceeding with a transaction that IDC believes is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders,” IDC wrote Friday, adding it “does not believe” a sale could be “implemented” without the investor’s support. Curve’s auditors earlier this year had warned of “material uncertainty” at the firm, according toCityAM. Financial figures published in March revealed the company had paused its plans to expand to the U.S. and, in 2023, cut about a third of its workforce, according totech.eu. Curve reported a pretax loss of £36 million in 2023, up from £69 million the year before. Bialick, when asked if Curve would be profitable in 2024, said the company’s “priority is sustainable expansion, and we anticipate reaching break-even in the near term.” Curve touts a digital wallet platform that brings all of a user’s cards and alternative payment sources into one place, while offering payment flexibility, real-time spend insights and no foreign exchange fees. In a statement onCurve’s blog Wednesday, Bialick said Curve’s “mission” has always been to “simplify and supercharge people’s finances.” “Joining forces with Lloyds Banking Group means we can now scale that vision faster, helping tens of millions more customers unlock smarter payments, and empower greater financial accessibility,” he said. Curve, on its own, counts 6 million customers. Lloyds, by comparison, reaches 28 million. The bank announced in January it planned toclose 136 branchesin the U.K. as customers rely more heavily on digital banking. Buying a digital wallet platform, presumably, would dovetail with that vision. “Building on the innovative changes we’ve made to our app recently, integrating Curve’s cutting-edge technology and digital wallet capabilities will deliver a next-generation digital banking experience for our customers as we help them to take control of their finances in a simple and convenient way,” Jas Singh, CEO of consumer relationships at Lloyds, said in a release Wednesday. Lloyds said Wednesday the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the bank, or to affect full-year guidance for 2025 or 2026.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/lloyds-bank-uk-acquire-fintech-curve-digital-wallet-120-million-idc-investor-concern/806065/,,
NY AG’s office scrutinizes SoLo Funds,"Fintech lender SoLo Funds is engaged with the New York attorney general’s office related to usury concerns, an executive said this week. Denzel Singletary, head of government affairs and strategic partnerships at the company, said SoLo Funds was served a subpoena this year by state AG Letitia James’ office. “We're in negotiations with them now, figuring out … what common ground looks like,” Singletary said, speaking Monday at the Banking Transformation Summit in Charlotte, North Carolina, on the topic of fintechs and regulators working together. James’ office declined to comment Tuesday. After SoLo Funds was subpoenaed, “my job initially was to make sure New York knew that we were not working in a nefarious way,” Singletary said. He said he highlighted the fintech’s community platform and tried to dispel misconceptions customers are being charged exorbitant interest rates. SoLo Funds bills itself as a community finance platform. Its business model has drawn the attention of regulators in a handful of states who view its “tip” structure asa predatory lending practice. In recent years, SoLo hasreached agreements with regulatorsin California, Washington, D.C., Connecticut and Pennsylvania related toallegations borrowers were required to pay large “tips” to access loans through its platform. In May 2024,the Los Angeles-based fintech was suedby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau,then under the Biden administration, also took issue with SoLo’s “tip” structure, which it said obscured the total cost of loans. The CFPB also said SoLo, which marketed itself as a consumer-friendly alternative to pricier, short-term loans, hid from borrowers the option to forgo a tip, and offered loans to borrowers in states that require platforms to have a license. SoLo said it had long since changed some components of its display the CFPB called out in the lawsuit. In February, under the Trump administration, the CFPBdropped the lawsuitagainst SoLo Funds. Russ Vought, the CFPB’s acting director who also leads the OMB, said at the time that the bureau under former director Rohit Chopra “shockingly” tried to “destroy” SoLo, “which incurred millions in legal fees and had to lay off 30% of its workforce.” “It was wrong and we dismissed the case,” Vought said. Prior tojoining SoLo Funds in 2024, Singletary was the director of U.S. government affairs at investing fintech Robinhood. “When SoLo Funds reached out to me to come and work with them,” he said, “it was this opportunity of figuring out, how do I make this fintech work well with regulators? What can I do to strengthen this relationship with this particular fintech and regulators?” That task was made far more difficult when, two weeks after he joined SoLo Funds, the firm was sued by the CFPB. He called that “a very interesting intro into the company,” but said he wasn’t deterred in seeking to make sure the regulator and the fintech understood each other. Then came a “blessing” in the form of the presidential administration change in January, Singletary said. “It was an opportunity for us to state our case in front of a new body, really,” he said. In doing that, the fintech focused on its community of users. “What does this whole community look like? What is this application actually doing? Who is it actually helping?” he said. “The customers are always going to make it make sense for the regulators,” he said. “I highlighted the fact that even though there's misconceptions, that we were facing those and actually working through them.” SoLo Funds became the first company to have a lawsuit dismissed by the current CFPB, which has since dropped a number of lawsuits filed under the Biden administration. “I genuinely think that's because we highlighted the community,” Singletary said. “Bodies really matter” when it comes to cooperation between fintechs and regulators. As the CFPB has reversed course on a number of actions, James has been quick to pick up the mantle in New York. Her officesued Capital Oneover lost interest payments to consumers andsued Early Warningover alleged fraud at Zelle – and initiated both after the CFPB dropped similar lawsuits this year. James’ office has also filed lawsuits against earned wage access providersMoneyLion and DailyPay, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to thousands of workers. Travis Holoway and Rodney Williams, the founders of SoLo Funds, soughtto establish an alternative to costly payday lenders, Singletary said. They“were two college-educated men who had made it, and their friends and family were consistently asking them for loans,” Singletary said. SoLo Funds, which launched in 2018, offers checking accounts and debit cards, and through its loan marketplace, members can request loans that other users can fund. The fintech – which taps Bangor Savings Bank for banking services – has about 2 million customers and 1.8 million deposit accounts, and has facilitated about $1 billion in transactions, Singletary said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ny-ag-james-solo-funds-tips-cfpb-fintech-regulators/806024/,,
Senators back open banking rule,"Several Senate Democrats on Thursday called on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to keep pursuing open banking rules that give consumers the ability to easily shift their personal data from one financial institution to another. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut pressed CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought in a letter seen by Payments Dive to continue the federal agency’s work in writing a rule under the Dodd-Frank Act that would further such consumer rights, without fees. The agency issued such a rule last year during the Biden administration, but bank trade groups sued over the regulation and it has been tied up in court. Under Vought’s leadership, the agency stopped backing the Biden-era rule in the litigation, which a judge has stayed, pending the agency’s decision to rewrite the rule. At the same time, Vought is aggressively shrinking the agency and threatening to shutter it, leaving the rule’s future in doubt. “We are concerned that the Trump CFPB’s policymaking seems to be more driven by the seesawing interests of big banks and other industry groups than with protecting consumers’ rights to their own data, as mandated by law,” the senators wrote in their letter. The senators alsoissued a press releaseThursday, insisting Vought reinstate the priorPersonal Financial Data Rights rule. “In the absence of the rule, big banks have demonstrated that they intend to charge exorbitant fees for this data to choke off competition and concentrate this data in the hands of a few large incumbents,” the senators wrote. The senators also contended that banks should not be allowed to charge for access to the data, saying it would be a violation of the law. “Large financial institutions have a monopoly over large swaths of consumer data and thus have the potential to drive out competitors and start ups in the data sharing market,” the letter said. The senators specifically called out JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, for imposing fees this year on third-party data aggregators, including the fintech Plaid. That bank’s fees were “at rates high enough to paralyze the market,” the letter said, noting that PayPal’s peer-to-peer payment tool Venmo and neobank Chime use Plaid to connect users’ bank accounts to their apps. JPMorgan Chase was set to impose an estimated $300 million in new fees annually on Plaid, the senators said, citing an article from Forbes, before the companies reached an agreement in September on terms that weren’t disclosed. JPMorgan Chase’s initial fee structure “indicates where the market may be moving absent the CFPB’s rule,” the letter said. A second data aggregator, Yodlee, this month said it had reached anupdated agreementwith JPMorgan Chase over access fees. The senators argued that “it is critical that any revisions the CFPB makes to the Personal Financial Data Rights rule recognize the importance of consumers being able to exercise their rights, which includes deciding how and by whom their data is used.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/open-banking-cfpb-warren-wyden-blumenthal-vought-jpmorgan-plaid-chime-venmo-yodlee/806190/,,
Florida credit union to buy Georgia bank,"Jacksonville, Florida-based Community First Credit Union of Florida will buy Waycross, Georgia-based First Southern Bank, creating a $3.3 billion-asset institution, thecredit union announced Tuesday. The deal, which would extend the credit union’s footprint into southeast Georgia and elsewhere into Florida, is thesecond CU-bank tie-up announced this week,after El Paso, Texas-based GECU proposed buying Roswell, New Mexico-based Bank of the Southwest on Monday. “While we love the growth opportunities that come with the transaction, this acquisition is founded on a unified vision between Community First and First Southern Bank,” Sam Inman, CEO of Community First, said in a prepared statement. “Both institutions emphasize a community-oriented and relationship-based approach, maintaining a culture that respects individuals and prioritizes service excellence.” Both institutions are storied: Community First is 90 years old. First Southern is 118 years old. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both institutions, is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2026. After that, First Southern’s holding company will liquidate, dissolve and distribute any remaining assets to its stockholders. The new Community First will count roughly $2.5 billion in loans and $2.9 billion in deposits across 31 branches. “First Southern Bank customers will continue to see their trusted familiar banker at each location,” said First Southern CEO Daniel Hager in a prepared statement. “The newly combined institution will have the ability to offer highly personalized financial services, which will enable us the financial capabilities to support further expansion.” Community First plans to retain all First Southern employees, stretching its headcount to 530. “Combining will expand services and strengthen community impact,” Community First said in a Q&A on its website. Tie-ups between credit unions and banks are not without challengers.Independent Community Bankers of America CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey released a statement Tuesday calling for policymakers “to address the harmful impact these deals have on local communities.” CitingICBA data, Rainey said the deals harm “small businesses and local communities while community banks outperform credit unions in high-poverty areas.” She called for Congress to eliminate the federal tax exemption for credit unions with more than $1 billion in assets. More than 80% of deals since 2010 have involved credit unions of that size, ICBA found. Four in 10 deals have involved a credit union headquartered in a different state than the acquired bank. Small Business Administration lending fell almost 80% at community banks that were acquired by credit unions, according to ICBA, and the amount loaned per approved mortgage application at the institutions decreased 61%. Michael Bell, a partner at Honigman who often architects such deals – including this one – told Banking Dive that ICBA’s statements are without “substance.” “The ICBA equates size to evil for some reason,” he said. “I ask the ICBA, is a $1 billion community bank still a community bank? Should all community banks larger than $1 billion give up the many tax subsidies enjoyed by community banks?”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/florida-credit-union-buy-georgia-bank/805897/,,
White House nominates Vought aide to lead CFPB,"Additionally, Geof Gradler was named deputy director of the CFPB. He’s a former lobbyist who joined the bureau about four months ago, according tohis LinkedIn profile. The CFPB spokesperson declined to comment on the fate of the agency, or whether the bureau intended to make a similar move in another 210 days. Vought said last monthon a podcast that onlyRepublican appointees and a few career employees remain “while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months,” Vought said. Trump administration officials have tried repeatedly this yearto hobble or shutterthe agency but have, at times run into court-ordered roadblocks. The CFPB spokesperson said the hearing process likely will be a moot point for Levenbach. The Senate probably wouldn’t get around to it until next year, the spokesperson said, and with Vought not going anywhere, the formal process may not occur. Michael Emancipator, senior vice president and regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America,noted on LinkedInWednesday that Levenbach’s nomination appears to be “merely a resetting of the clock” under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. And McGuireWoods partner Jeff Ehrlich, a former deputy enforcement director at the CFPB, said the nomination is “likely a placeholder,” according toa LinkedIn post. The spokesperson pointed toa news releasethe bureau issued last week, in which the CFPB said itinformed the court inNTEU v. Voughtthat the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the CFPBcan’t legally request fundsfrom the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB “anticipates having sufficient funds to continue operations until at least December 31,” the release said.DOJ attorneys told the court that available funds are expected to run out in early 2026. Levenbach is also vice chair of theNational Capital Planning Commission, a panel that Voughtthreatened to involvein this summer’s dust-up over an over-budget renovation at the Federal Reserve. Levenbach served as chief of staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during Trump’s first term. Later, he became a senior adviser with the White House National Economic Council and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, according tohis LinkedIn profile. Prior to those roles, he spent about a decade at OMB. “Donald Trump’s sending the Senate a new nominee to lead the CFPB looks like nothing more than a front for Russ Vought to stay on as Acting Director indefinitely as he tries to illegally close down the agency,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a Wednesday statement. “Instead of doing everything in their power to lower costs for Americans, Trump and Vought want to make it easier for giant corporations to scam families out of their money.” Consumer Bankers Association CEO Lindsey Johnson said Levenbach’s nomination “comes at a critical time for consumers and the financial services marketplace.” “America’s leading Main Street banks look forward to continuing to work with the Trump Administration on data-driven, pro-growth policies that will support hardworking Americans and drive the economy forward, while at the same time ensuring the Bureau fulfills its statutory mission and sticks to what Congress authorized it to do,” she said in a Wednesday statement. “This will not only help restore the trust and credibility of the CFPB, but will benefit consumers, industry, and the broader economy alike.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-director-levenbach-vought-omb-trump/805913/,,
LevelField gets state approval to buy Chicago bank,"LevelField filed a fresh application to buy Burling inDecember 2024. In that paperwork, the Houston firm said it would pay roughly $70 million for the bank, which counts a single branch and $209.5 million in assets. The combined entity will be renamed LevelField Bank but maintain Burling’s community banking business. However, it will add a focus on deposit accounts, loans and custody services tailored to digital assets, including term loans and credit cards secured by bitcoin or Ether, according to the application. Burling's CEO, Michael Busch, will become president of LevelField Bank, Grant said. From the beginning, LevelField said it sought to become the first full-service chartered bank to offer traditional banking and digital asset services on one platform across the U.S. ""The idea is, once we have a customer, they don't have to go outside the bank perimeter for anything they want to do in digital assets,” Grant told American Banker. Grant said he expects acquisition to be finalized by the end of this year. Only Burling’s cannabis banking business will retain the Burling brand, LevelField said. To accommodate the anticipated round-the clock needs of its digital-asset user base, LevelField aims to hire roughly 100 employees in 2026 – mostly in customer service, Grant said. Once LevelField receives regulatory approval, it aims to raise $112.5 million, according to its December 2024 filing. That is meant to cover the acquisition of the bank, $20 million in growth capital and $17.5 million that LevelField will retain, the company said. In a release Monday, Grant thanked investors “for backing the patient, disciplined work it took to meet the necessary supervisory standards that protect consumers and businesses and make the U.S. the home of the world leading banking system."" As far as embracing crypto, Grant said the banking system can either ""live in denial or we can try to safely integrate it … in such a way that it works collaboratively and doesn't endanger the system."" “Financial services must be changed from the inside, and unlike other industries, outside disruptors barely move the needle,” Granttold Bloomberg.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/levelfield-acquire-burling-bank-illinois-regulator-approval-crypto-digital-asset/805947/,,
FDIC countersues Capital One over special assessment,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. accused Capital One of paying $99.4 million less than necessary to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund following the 2023 failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, according tocourt documents filed Monday. The FDIC’s lawsuit countered legal action takenin Septemberagainst the regulator by the bank, which alleged the FDICimposed an “outsized and improperly calculated” special assessment fee on Capital One. The FDIC inflated its assessment against Capital One by $149.2 million, the bank said in September. At issue is a $56 billion position between two Capital One subsidiaries which, according to Monday’s lawsuit, Capital One excluded in its reporting of uninsured deposits. Capital One said the agency “erroneously” included the position as uninsured deposits, inflating what the bank owed. The FDIC used funds from the DIF to protect uninsured depositors when banks fail. When SVB and Signature Bank were seized by the FDIC in March 2023, most of their deposits – 88% and 67%, respectively – were above the FDIC’s $250,000 threshold and “uninsured.” To recoup DIF funds later that year, the FDIC implemented a special assessment on the nation’s largest banks, including Capital One.

JPMorgan Chase enhancing due diligence for clients in the Amazon region,"The change itself does not come with any inherent restrictions on client activities or transactions in the region, but a JPMorgan spokesperson told ESG Dive on Wednesday that each activity and transaction will be considered “on a case-by-case basis, in line with [its] risk appetite and commercial interests.” “Managing risk is critical to the long-term success of our business,” the bank’s spokesperson said in emailed comments. “We added Amazon Biome as one example of a business location associated with clients and/or transactions we consider sensitive or in need of enhanced review, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.” The RAISG geospatial definition, which JPMorgan will use to define the biome, “is widely recommended by Indigenous leaders and activists,” according to Stand.earth. Allison Fajans-Turner, a senior campaigner at the Rainforest Action Network — one of the environmental organizations backing the annual Banking on Climate Chaos reports — said requiring enhanced due diligence for activities in the Amazon biome is “the bare minimum that we should expect from other large backers of Amazon drilling.” “JPMorgan Chase has finally taken an essential — if long-overdue — step to confront its role as the largest financier of oil and gas extraction in the Amazon,” Fajans-Turner said in Stand.earth’s Nov. 13 release. After 30% of JPMorgan’s shareholders supported a proposal to require the bank to issue a report on its practices on Indigenous People's rights in the 2024 proxy season, JPMorgan reached an agreement with shareholders proposing a similar filing in the most recent proxy season. The United Church Fundwithdrew its proposal to the bankin April — afterJPMorgan submitted a no-action requeston the filing — once the bank agreed to add a disclosure stating “the company will consider free, prior and informed consent where risks are identified before proceeding with transactions that may have material implications for Indigenous Peoples.” “Promises on paper to respect Indigenous and human rights and screen clients operating in the Amazon biome fall far short of what’s needed: real financing exclusions applied to the Amazon and other fragile ecosystems and rigorous implementation of human rights protections for Indigenous peoples and all affected local communities,” Fajans-Turner said in the Nov. 13 release. In addition to the Arctic and the Amazon, JPMorgan requires a case-by-case enhanced review for coal mining and coal-fired power activities; clients whose “main business is the physical trading of conflict minerals,” cobalt or diamond trading; and hydropower, agricultural commodities or downstream agricultural commodity use in non-designated countries.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-enhancing-due-diligence-amazon-region-clients-standearth/806007/,,
Investor blasts Comerica over Fifth Third deal,"Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management on Monday probed Comerica’s $10.9 billion deal to be acquired by Fifth Third and threatened legal action against the bank if more information on the deal process isn’t released. Additionally, Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions was Comerica’s first suitor, before the Dallas-based bank struck a deal with Fifth Third,American Bankerreported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Spokespeople for Regions and Fifth Third declined to comment. A Comerica spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July,accusing the regional lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” HoldCo, whichowns about 2.04 million shares of Comerica stock,suggested PNC, Fifth Third or Huntington as possible buyers. In October, Fifth Third said it wasacquiring Comerica for $10.9 billionin stock. Earlier this month,a regulatory filingrevealed that the Cincinnati-based lender was not Comerica’s first suitor. The CEO of another bank, identified as Financial Institution A in the filing, proposed an all-stock transaction with $78 billion-asset Comerica in September. But Comerica’s board determined the terms “were not likely to be more attractive than the consideration that could be offered by another counterparty.” HoldCo’s65-page presentation issued Monday, which parsed recent regulatory filings, alleged a lack of board oversight in Comerica CEO Curt Farmer’s interactions with Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence and the absence of a competitive process in the Fifth Third deal, saying “this isn’t negotiation; it’s surrender.” HoldCo accused Comerica’s board of ignoring Financial Institution A’s proposals, a choice it called “indefensible,” and contended “had you engaged, we believe those ‘preliminary’ bids would have matured into definitive proposals — at likely materially higher levels.” HoldCo also critiqued Farmer’s “windfall” – he’s set to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks – and the deal’s “aggressive” breakup fee of $500 million. The acquisition is set to face a shareholder vote in January. HoldCo demanded a raft of details, calling on Comerica to “provide a more complete and transparent chronology of the events leading up to the Fifth Third transaction.” That includes when the board first discussed potential responses to shareholder pressure and when it authorized Comerica management to explore a merger, as well as information on the identity of Financial Institution A, the timing, substance and financial terms of its proposals, and whether Comerica or its advisers engaged with that bank. “The apparent absence of any follow-up engagement with a bidder who made an offer — combined with the lack of evidence that J.P. Morgan sought to create competition between bidders — suggests a process engineered to favor Fifth Third rather than one designed to maximize shareholder value,” the activist investor said. HoldCo also pressed for details on the decision to hire JPMorgan Chase as Comerica’s financial adviser, and seeks more specifics related to Farmer’s conversations with Spence. “The size and timing of Mr. Farmer’s compensation package strongly indicate a potential conflict of interest — namely, that Fifth Third effectively ‘overpaid’ the CEO to secure a lower purchase price for shareholders,” the activist said. If the bank doesn’t provide the requested detail, “we will have to consider seeking expedited relief in the Delaware Court of Chancery to obtain the disclosures we believe are warranted,” HoldCo said. The activist may also consider bringing fiduciary-duty claims in the Delaware court. In recent months, Regions executives have repeatedly expressed disinterest in acquiring a bank, instead eyeing the opportunity to snag customers and talentamid disruption caused by other M&Aactivity. Regions CFO David Turner reiterated those views this month at theBancAnalysts Association of Boston conference– which would have been after the bank reportedly proposed a deal with Comerica. “We're, I think, the only bank that hadn't done an acquisition since 2006,” Turner said Nov. 7. The bank had just finished its strategic plan, “and M&A is not part of that plan,” he said. “It's just not part of where we want to focus our time and attention. And we understand things can change, but that's just not where we are today,” Turner added. Still, one analyst noted some wonder whether the bank’s position may change. “With increased M&A activity in their Southeast backyard, there have been investors who wonder if [Regions management] would start to feel compelled to take part in the M&A wave, particularly since the company is profitable but has had challenges growing organically,” Truist Securities analyst Brian Finneran wrote in a Tuesday note.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/holdco-activist-comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-regions/805807/,,
Revolut valued at $75B,"Revolut is valued at $75 billion after completing a share sale, theBritish fintech said Monday. Revolut did not disclose how many shares were sold or the amount raised. It’s the fifth share sale Revolut has allowed its staff to date, with the fintech asserting it’s “one of the most liquid employee share programmes across private companies in the industry.” The new valuation marks significant growth sinceRevolut’s $45 billion valuation 15 months ago, which came directly after it received its long-awaitedBritish banking license. Since then, Revolut has entered multiple markets,named a chairof its Western Europe arm and finalized itsbanking license in Mexico. It’s also exploring U.S. growth, with Revolut U.S. CEO Sid Jajodia saying in October thatnabbing a stateside charteris part of the firm’s growth “mission.” “The level of investor interest and our new valuation reflect the strength of our business model, which is delivering both rapid growth and strong profitability,” CFO Victor Stinga said in a prepared statement on the recent share sale. “We welcome onboard a series of world-class investors and look forward to working with them for the next stage in Revolut’s evolution.” The transaction was led by Coatue, Greenoaks, Dragoneer and Fidelity Management & Research Company. Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Andreessen Horowitz, Franklin Templeton and T. Rowe Price Associates also participated. In ablog postMonday, Coatue wrote that it sees Revolut “charting a new path.” “They are building the world’s first global financial super-app, which is now operating in 39 countries and serves over 65 million users,” wrote Brendan O’Boyle, Rohan Bharvani and Lucas Swisher, investors at Coatue, which also led Revolut’s 2024 funding round. “What began as a travel card designed to avoid high [foreign exchange] fees has evolved into a multi-product financial platform that is redefining what modern banking looks like for consumers and businesses.” Revolut’s 2024 revenue grew 72% to $4 billion year over year, with profit before tax more than doubling to $1.4 billion. Its Revolut Business arm hit $1 billion in annualized revenue in 2025, the company said. The new valuation “reflects the remarkable progress we have made in the last twelve months towards our vision of building the first truly global bank, serving 100 million customers across 100 countries,” CEO Nik Storonsky said in a prepared statement.

"Comerica, Fifth Third sued by activist investor","Just days after threatening legal action against Comerica, HoldCo Asset Management has sued the regional bank and its proposed buyer, Fifth Third. The activist investor accused Comerica CEO Curt Farmer of being “focused solely on advancing his own interests” based on the “rushed” way the Dallas-based bank’s proposed$10.9 billion acquisition by Fifth Thirdcame together. Theclass-action complaint, filed Friday in the Delaware Court of Chancery by HoldCo Opportunities Fund, alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by Comerica and its board members related to the transaction and its “draconian” provisions. It also accuses the bank of leaving out material information from disclosures related to the deal. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCo also accused Fifth Third of “aiding-and-abetting” the board in breaching its fiduciary duty. HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July, accusing the lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” In October, Fifth Third announced it would acquire Comerica. HoldCoissued a presentationlast week that picked apart the proposed deal, threatening to take Comerica to court if it didn’t release more information on how the agreement came together. Comerica rebuffed at leastone earlier suitor, Financial Institution A, according to a disclosure. That was Regions Bank, American Banker reported. The deal between Comerica and Fifth Third was “negotiated over an extraordinarily compressed timeline,” HoldCo’s Friday complaint contends. It was driven by Farmer’s “fear of an activist contest” led by HoldCo, “and his fear that no other bidder would keep him on,” the firm alleged. “Fearing for his job, Farmer raced to find a friendly white knight that could provide him with a lucrative post-closing role,” the complaint asserts. Farmer isset to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks. Part of the rush, HoldCo claims, was to avoid any proxy contest at Comerica’s annual meeting, to have been held by May 2026. The Fifth Third deal is projected to close in the first quarter of 2026. Although Comerica received an offer from Financial Institution A, the complaint alleges the Dallas bank decided to “nip those negotiations in the bud” and solely focus on Fifth Third. The deal came together hastily and in a way that ensures “no topping bid could disrupt Farmer’s entrenchment plan,” HoldCo attorneys alleged. The merger agreement carries a “gargantuan” termination fee of $500 million and “an absurdly narrow fiduciary-out” that doesn’t let the board scrap the merger for a higher bid, HoldCo said in the complaint. The “draconian” deal protections mean Comerica’s board couldn’t terminate the acquisition for a better proposal until October 2026, even if shareholders don’t vote in favor of the deal, the filing said. HoldCo also alleges the registration statement is “materially misleading and incomplete” and doesn’t provide shareholders with any details that would allow them to compare the deal’s terms with Financial Institution A’s proposed offers. “There is no evidence from the Registration Statement that Comerica ever made a counterproposal or tried to negotiate for a price above the lowest end of the exchange ratio range in Fifth Third’s initial proposal,” the complaint said. “Nor is there any evidence that Comerica made any attempt to re-engage Financial Institution A (to see if it would provide a better proposal) or solicit interest from other potential bidders.” The 17-day span – from the start of potential merger conversations between Farmer and Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence to when an agreement was signed – “is the shortest timeframe of any of the ten largest bank mergers, with the next shortest taking 43 days and the median taking 67 days,” HoldCo contended. “Such negotiations are more reminiscent of distressed bank sales during the 2008 global financial crisis,” the complaint said. In aresponse filed Monday, attorneys for Comerica argued HoldCo’s views are at odds with those of other bank shareholders, and blasted the activist for “asking this Court to deprive stockholders of a merger after agitating for just such a deal.” Fifth Third’s attorneys, in aseparate Monday filing, called HoldCo’s aiding and abetting assertion a “facially meritless claim.” “This case is only about HoldCo’s self-serving activism goals,” Fifth Third’s attorneys said. Comerica and Fifth Third attorneys accused HoldCo of “gamesmanship” and called its claims weak. Comerica’s lawyers also needled HoldCo for “revel[ing] in its notoriety” after pushing for the bank to sell itself and seeking credit for the outcome. Comerica’s attorneys also noted HoldCo was in communication with the bank’s counsel in the days leading up to filing Friday’s complaint. “At no time during those communications did HoldCo indicate it would be filing a suit to enjoin the deal on Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week,” Comerica’s attorneys said. The shareholder vote on the acquisition is tentatively scheduled for Jan. 6. A hearing was set to be held Tuesday related to a motion to expedite the case. Spokespeople for Comerica and Fifth Third declined to comment. Attorneys withBernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman, the law firm representing HoldCo, didn’t return requests for comment. HoldCo also didn’t respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-sued-activist-investor-holdco/806428/,,
Fulton Financial to buy NJ’s Blue Foundry in $243M deal,"Fulton Financial Corp.will acquire Blue Foundry Bancorpin an all-stock transaction valued at $243 million, the companies announced Monday. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, pushes Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based Fulton into northern New Jersey. The bank gained a presence in the southern part of the state last year with itsacquisition of Republic First. The Philadelphia-based bank had locations in New Jersey and New York before it failed. Acquiring $2.15 billion-asset Blue Foundry, headquartered in Rutherford, New Jersey, gives $32 billion-asset Fulton 21 additional branches in eight counties, including four of the state’s most populous. “The expansion in northern New Jersey aligns with our strategy of growing in our local markets and positions us well to drive organic growth across our commercial, consumer, wealth advisory and mortgage businesses,” Fulton CEO Curtis Myers said in a prepared statement. “The combination of our companies creates an opportunity to leverage Fulton’s robust banking services and provide greater convenience and innovative solutions to an expanded customer base, with a continued focus on supporting our local communities,” he said. Under the terms of the agreement, Blue Foundry investors will receive 0.65 shares of Fulton common stock for each share they own. The transaction’s estimated $243 million value stems from Fulton’s $17.96 share price from Friday. “Joining forces with Fulton is an exciting step forward for our employees, customers and communities,” Blue Foundry CEO James Nesci said in a prepared statement. “This partnership allows us to preserve the local relationships and personalized service our customers value, while gaining access to greater resources and providing more solutions and convenience to customers.” In recent years, Blue Foundry has been a publicly traded bank, during which time it has reported more than $20 million in losses,American Bankerreported. Activist investor Larry Seidman, who had pushed for its sale via proxy campaign last year, told American Banker there was “no question whatsoever” that Fulton would be able to produce better results than Blue Foundry has with its assets. “It's a good bank with good management,” Seidman said of Fulton. “Blue Foundry was horrible. They couldn't make any money.” The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to tangible book value per share. It’s expected to be accretive to first full-year earnings by over 5%, and neutral to regulatory capital ratios at close. As part of the deal, Fulton will make a $1.5 million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation, which provides impact grants to nonprofit community organizations in New Jersey.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fulton-financial-to-buy-nj-blue-foundry-243m-deal/806443/,,
MoneyLion to pay $1.75M to settle CFPB lawsuit,"MoneyLion agreed Friday topay $1.75 millionto settle a long-running lawsuit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, alleging the fintech charged more than the maximum 36% interest rate allowed by the Military Lending Act on loans to service members. The settlement narrows – to 12 – the number of cases the CFPB has in active litigation, based on acount given last weekby a representative of the bureau’s workers union. The CFPB has dismissed 22 enforcement actions this year. The case also bolsters the CFPB’s commitment –from April, and subsequently reinforced in a “humility pledge” Friday – to focus on providing redress to service members, veterans and their families. As part of the settlement, MoneyLion is barred from extending consumer credit at rates higher than 36% to borrowers for whom the MLA cap applies. That includes credit insurance premiums or fees, any fee for a debt cancellation contract or debt suspension agreement, or any fee for a credit-related ancillary product sold as part of a credit transaction. It also includes finance charges, application fees or membership fees. That was a focal point of the CFPB’sSeptember 2022 lawsuitagainst the company. MoneyLion required customers to join a membership program – which carried a monthly fee between $19.99 and $29 – to access the fintech’s low annual percentage rate installment loan product, the bureau said when the suit was first filed. But the company failed to allow borrowers to cancel their memberships until their loans were paid, and in some cases, wouldn’t cancel memberships if the borrower had unpaid membership fees, the CFPB added. Friday’s settlement bars MoneyLion from preventing borrowers from canceling their membership. It also does not permit the fintech to engage in collections activities for past unpaid membership fees, collecting membership fees for periods when memberships were suspended. MoneyLion also can’t prevent borrowers from paying off loans in full by using funds in their credit reserve account, according to the settlement. Nor can the company ding borrowers’ credit scores over unpaid membership fees. Also as part of the settlement, MoneyLion must submit an accurate written compliance report, sworn under penalty of perjury, to the CFPB, detailing the number of borrowers who received redress and the amount paid to each. The settlement covers borrowers who had outstanding MoneyLion loans between December 2017 and October 2024. MoneyLion, in September 2022, disputed the CFPB’s allegations, accusing the regulator of taking a “sensationalist route of prioritizing headlines instead of engaging in constructive dialogue.” “MoneyLion has the highest regard for its military and veteran customers and [is] committed to working with this important community to help them achieve better financial health,” the company said at the time. “MoneyLion is honored to serve this important segment of its customer base and is grateful for the sacrifice these men and women have made for our country.” The membership offering represents a small subset of MoneyLion’s business, the company said at the time. Since then, the fintech has come under new management: MoneyLionwas acquired this yearby Gen Digital forabout $1 billion. The CFPB is also not the only entity with a consumer-protection case against MoneyLion.New York’s attorney generalsued MoneyLion and fellow earned wage access provider DailyPay in April, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to tens of thousands of workers with fees that “amount to outrageous annual interest rates in the triple digits.” Thecity of Baltimorelast month sued MoneyLion, alleging the company misled and manipulated consumers into taking out small-dollar, short-term loans that come with high fees. MoneyLion in 2023 persuaded the judge in the CFPB case topause proceedingsahead of aSupreme Court rulingthat affirmed the bureau’s funding structure is constitutional.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-moneylion-settlement-mla-interest-rate-36-cap-military-membership-fees/806439/,,
U.S. Bank hires up for greater Southeast growth,"After adding bankers to serve businesses in Dallas and Houston, U.S. Bank is now focused on further expansion across the Southeast, a business banking executive said. Within the next six months, U.S. Bank plans to hire at least a dozen bankers in a couple of Southeast states where it doesn’t have branches, said Dee O’Dell, head of business banking sales at the Minneapolis-based lender. He didn’t elaborate, butthat group includesAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. The super-regional bank has recently added teams of bankers in markets where it’s seeing greater growth opportunity, including a second team in Charlotte, North Carolina; a second in Las Vegas; and a fourth in Chicago, O’Dell said during a recent interview. In his unit, about 250 people have been hired into new roles this year. In Houston, where the $695 billion-asset bank announced last week it added a business banking team, four people have been hired and the lender plans to bring on two more, he said. In U.S. Bank’s business banking segment, which serves companies generating between $2.5 million to $50 million in annual revenue, about 1,200 employees across the country serve about 75,000 clients, O’Dell said. The consumer and business banking segmentmakes up about 32%of the lender’s overall revenue, which was $21.3 billion year to date,as of Sept. 30. U.S. Bank provides those commercial clients with different types of credit for their capital needs, including conventional financing, owner-occupied real estate loans and Small Business Administration loans. Clients in that size range often “not only have their primary business, but they're looking for ways to diversify,” O’Dell said. “They not only want to own the building they're in, they may want to own some other buildings as well, and so we've got the ability to provide capital for them, not only for their core business, but for investment real estate.” Bankers also seek to connect clients with other U.S. Bank services, such as credit cards, merchant processing, treasury management, foreign exchange and wealth management. Amid a highly competitive landscape, the lender has sharpened efforts to offer anddeliver services to clientsin a comprehensive way, O’Dell said. “Our approach has been to integrate all that together so that there is value that comes from having all of that in one place,” he said. To zero in on where businesses could gain the most benefit, the bank developed – along with a fintech O’Dell wouldn’t name – a proprietary diagnostic tool for companies. The questionnaire assesses business needs and money movement, diagnoses the level of efficiency in those functions and has a team review results with business clients. “The idea is that instead of trying to sell any one of those products, we're approaching it in a much more consultative and holistic way,” O’Dell said. “It helps our clients see how they can be even more efficient, save time in their day, eliminate risk of fraud, other things like that.” That diagnostic effort has bolstered the bank’s success rate in serving new clients since it was introduced nearly two years ago, O’Dell said. “Sometimes our bankers will meet with a company that we don't bank with today. And if your question is, ‘Do you need any banking services?’ The answer might be, ‘No, no, everything's fine. It's all good,’” O’Dell said. “If we can get them to engage with us and have this conversation and fill out this basic template questionnaire, we can go back and provide insights. And often, it opens up a conversation where companies don't even realize the things that they are doing or not doing that could lead to so much greater efficiency.” Another newer internal tool aggregates data to give bankers a view of companies or prospects within the markets they serve, allowing them to sort by sales size, industry type or ownership of property, so they can better target clients based on potential needs, O’Dell said. SBA loans may be a prime option for some of those businesses and that’s an area of lending U.S. Bank seeks to grow further, since it can serve as a company’s entry point into the bank. U.S. Bank has doubled its SBA lending in the past two years, O’Dell said. In fiscal 2025, the bank totaled $871.2 million in SBA 7(a) loans, up 23% from the previous fiscal year,it said last month. “We've been able to use that program to help a number of companies, individuals get capital they wouldn't otherwise be able to get, and because of the way that we approach that, and our client selection in that, the loss ratio that we've had in that space has been very attractive to our shareholders,” O’Dell said. SBA lending can be ideal in some succession situations, O’Dell noted. The segment of businesses O’Dell oversees has a significant number of owners nearing the end of their careers, so the bank also aims to jump on the chance to be involved in those moments. In cases where a business owner doesn’t have a child who wants to take over, they may look to sell to a similar company or private equity firm. Or if there’s someone in the company who’s interested in acquiring it but doesn’t have the capital, the bank can use an SBA loan to help with that pursuit. “We see great opportunities to help the next generation of business owners acquire business and a current generation who are at the end of their careers, exit, monetize what they've invested in, and have this sense that their legacy will continue,” O’Dell said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/us-bank-adding-business-bankers-southeast-odell/806212/,,
VALT Bank applies for de novo charter,"A group of former U.S. Bank executives is seeking federal approval to establish VALT Bank, applications submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Nov. 13 show. The proposed bank, headquartered in Eagle, Idaho, will be fully digital and will focus on serving “digitally demanding small to midsized businesses” in the U.S., according to its application. VALT plans to offer credit and deposit products as well as treasury and cash management services, and plans to provide clients with SMB-focused automation solutions. The bank will be led by proposed director, CEO and President Matt Gediman, whose nearly two-decade U.S. Bank career culminated in three years as a managing director in the bank’s private wealth management business. “When we refer to ‘digitally demanding SMBs,’ we mean revenue-generating small and midsized businesses that use technology across their daily operations and expect the same level of technological fluency from their financial service providers,” Gediman told Banking Dive via email Monday. These are traditional businesses, he added – not tech firms or crypto companies. VALT does not plan to interact with digital assets. “Our customers are established SMBs that simply expect modern, reliable, integrated digital banking,” he said. “[O]ur model is designed to support them by making banking uncomplicated, accessible, and integrated with digital tools to run their businesses more efficiently,” he said. Former U.S. Bank Vice Chairman John Elmore is VALT’s proposed executive chair and Ross Carey, former U.S. Bank EVP of business banking and SBA division, is its proposed vice chair. Kim Hoyt, attorney at Salem, Oregon-based law firm Garrett Hemann Robertson, and Dana Johnson, president and chief investment officer at single-family office MidAmerica Capital Partners, are VALT’s additional proposed directors. The OCC declined to comment on the application, and the FDIC did not respond immediately to a request for comment. But the heads of both agencies have recently spoken in favor of increased de novo chartering. Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gouldtold Banking Dive last monththat one of his major goals while at the helm of the OCC is “invigorating de novo chartering in America.” Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hillnoted earlier this year that new bank formationhas “fallen off a cliff” in recent years. At the American Bankers Association’s Washington Summit in April, he noted that 412 new banks were formed in 1984 alone, and that the lowest number of new banks established in any year between 1995 and 2007 was 93. By comparison, just 86 new banks have been formed since 2010, Hill said, and more than half of them came between 2019 and 2022 when Trump appointee Jelena McWilliams ran the FDIC. The OCC and the FDIC have received a number of bank applications since President Donald Trump took office again in January. Applicants includingCoinbaseandStripe-owned Bridgeseek national trust charters, which do not allow for lending or taking insured deposits. One bank – Erebor Bank, which applied for a de novo charter in June – has received conditional approval under Gould’s leadership. Its conditional approval wasgranted in October. TheOCC leasing manualindicates that the agency should make decisions on a charter application within 120 days of receiving it, lining VALT up for an answer by mid-March. Gediman, for VALT’s part, said the team’s intention is to “build a safe, well-governed institution that meets the needs of modern business owners through a unique digital-first experience.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/valt-bank-applies-for-de-novo-charter/806295/,,
CFPB can’t ignore judge’s order: workers union,"Lawyers for a workers unionurged a federal courtSunday to clarify apreliminary injunctionto ensure that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau leaders don’t shutter the agency by refusing funding. “The defendants have filed a ‘notice’ announcing that they intend to allow the Bureau to run out of funding, and when it does, they will stop complying with the Court’s injunction,” attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union wrote Sunday. “Parties may not simply declare that an injunction no longer applies.” The CFPB this monthalertedthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it “anticipates exhausting its currently available funds in early 2026.” At issue is the definition of “combined earnings.” The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel sent a memo to CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought on Nov. 7, asserting that it interprets earnings – from which the Federal Reserve derives the CFPB’s operating budget – as profit rather than revenue. By that math, the Fed has operated at a loss since 2022. NTEU attorneys asserted Sunday that the Fed earns “billions of dollars a year – from interest on loans and securities, and fees assessed” on banks. But because the Fed has raised interest rates since 2022, its combined interest expenses have exceeded combined earnings. The plaintiffs cite congressional testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told lawmakers the central bank examined that balance “very carefully” and concluded the law is “very clear” that the Fed must fund the CFPB even when its expenses exceed its earnings. Further, NTEU attorneys said, the OLC memo “admits, nobody – not any court, not the Fed, and not the CFPB – has ever interpreted” combined earnings as it suggested this month. “Both the Fed and the CFPB (until Vought needed a mechanism to circumvent this Court’s injunction) have consistently understood ‘combined earnings’ to mean, simply, everything the Fed earns,” NTEU attorneys wrote. The OLC’s interpretation relies on “technical definitions from corporate accounting,” NTEU attorneys wrote. “But the Fed is not a private corporation. It sets monetary policy for the United States. … The only reason to adopt its reading of ‘combined earnings’ is to shut down the CFPB.” Vought, in an appearance last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” indeed said of the CFPB: “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within thenext two, three months.” The bureau last week indicated it istransferring all of its active litigationto the DOJ. By the OLC’s logic, NTEU attorneys wrote, Congress would have passed a Dodd-Frank Act “that forces the Federal Reserve Board to choose between increasing interest rates to combat inflation and funding the CFPB.” “Fortunately, that is not the law that Congress wrote,” the attorneys asserted, blasting the CFPB for not choosing another path. “Rather than asking this Court to modify its injunction (which would require them to demonstrate that it should), the defendants have chosen to just ‘inform’ the Court that they ‘do not understand’ the injunction to bind them once the CFPB runs out of money – even if that’s because they decided not to ask the Fed for funding,” NTEU attorneys wrote. Outside of the courtroom, the CFPB on Friday issued what it termed a “humility pledge” meant to be read aloud by bank examiners to banks before exams. The statement drills down on the bureau’snarrowing of focustoward consumer threats that harm service members, veterans and their families and reiterates that the bureau will “avoid, where possible, duplication of supervision, where States or other regulators are already doing that job.” The bureau pledges shorter examination times – reduced from eight weeks to a period “commensurate with the defined scope of exams.” “No longer will the Bureau ask for expansive data sets or other information which may seem unrelated to the exam or include information inconsistent with Bureau priorities,” the pledge reads. “Any follow-up requests by examiners will first be discussed with an entity and will be tailored to the scope of the exam and the information already received from the entity.” The CFPB states its goal as “[to] work collaboratively with the entities to review entities’ processes for compliance and/or remedy existing problems,” emphasizing self-reporting and encouraging banks to resolve issues with the CFPB’s supervision unit, rather than enforcement. That may lend credence to a narrative, from an all-hands meeting of enforcement staff, in which the bureau’s acting enforcement chief said all 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation at the end of the year. Curiously, perhaps, the pledge encourages banks, if they find their exam experience to be “inconsistent with these principles,” to reach out via email to a designated CFPB supervisory official or the bureau’s chief legal officer. In apost Monday on the NTEU’s website, union member Alexis Goldstein asked, “Why is Russell Vought showing the world his weird, creepy pledge of allegiance to big corporations?” Another union member, Doug Wilson, notes a passage in the pledge in which the bureau asserts that examiners will be “encouraged and incentivized to complete the work promptly and under budget.” “This memo doesn't add up,” Wilson wrote. “Vought’s stopped all supervision exams in 2025, refuses to fund CFPB and says he’s shutting us down by 2026. So how will we supervise banks in 2026 if CFPB is closed? How can bank exams be ‘under budget’ if there is no budget?” In an emailed press release to accompany the humility pledge, the CFPB characterized the bureau’s Biden-era supervision efforts as “thuggery,” calling out ex-supervision chief LoreleiSalas as “a former [Democratic donor George] Soros activist who wasput on leave in February 2025.” Further, bureau leadership labeled the pre-Trump supervision unit as “a weaponized arm of the CFPB.” In aLinkedIn post, Allison Preiss, who until February served as senior adviser to the CFPB director, said the humility pledge “might be better characterized as a humiliation pledge.” “The notion that federal employees should genuflect, trembling, before a Wells Fargo or Bank of America, is some of the most ridiculous nonsense I've read all week,” she wrote. In anotherLinkedIn post, Tyler Creighton, counsel at the CFPB, took issue with the idea that the bureau is calling out examiners’ past conduct. “Supervision's workers have always conducted examinations professionally, efficiently, conscientiously, and with a focus on remedying consumer harm,” he wrote. “We will continue to do so, just as soon as Donald Trump and Russell Vought end the nearly 10-month suspension of examinations and let us get back to work for the American people.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-humility-pledge-supervision-enforcement-bank-examiners-fed-funding-refuse-vought-court/806314/,,
Stripe faces bank charter pushback,"A national trust banking charter would let the digital payments giant Stripe offer banking services while sidestepping certain regulations, an advocacy organization opposingthe payment provider's charter applicationargued in a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency this month. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition alsosaid in the letterthat the charter would give Stripe legitimacy that it does not deserve, pointing to the fintech’s history of legal trouble. Stripe, whichacquired a stablecoin infrastructure companycalled Bridge this year, proposes to name the bank Bridge National Trust. “The OCC must reject Stripe’s application for a national trust bank charter due to serious concerns regarding Stripe’s disregard for enforcement, governance, compliance, and consumer protection laws,” according to the Nov. 13 letter, which is addressed to Sebastian Astrada, the agency’s director for licensing of novel banks. The NCRC is a coalition of hundreds of U.S. community-based organizations which run the gamut from faith-based nonprofits to social justice advocates. The organization posted the letter on its website last week. Bridgeapplied for the charter in October. The charter would give Bridge and its parent company the right to provide custody, stablecoin issuance, and management of stablecoin reserves within a federal framework, rather than through state-to-state money transmitter licenses. Spokespeople for Stripe did not respond to messages seeking comment about the NCRC’s letter. If the charter is approved, Bridge would form the Bridge National Trust Bank, to be headquartered in New York City, according tothe Oct. 14 application. CEO Patrick Collison co-founded Stripe along with his brother John Collison, who is president of the business. “We’ve long believed stablecoins will be a core, regulated building block,” Bridge co-founder Zach Abrams wroteon the social media platform Xlast month. “This regulatory infrastructure will enable us to tokenize trillions of dollars and make this future possible.” The crypto firmsCircle,Paxos,RippleandCoinbasehave also applied for charters through the OCC, although none of those applications has been approved yet. With the trust, Stripe could also facilitate payments without supervision from the Federal Reserve, the NCRC said in its letter. “Granting these firms limited purpose trust charters would blur the statutory boundaries of what constitutes a bank, undermine the credibility of the national charter, and heighten systemic risk by allowing them to operate under a lighter regulatory regime,” the group wrote. The coalition also outlines some of the lawsuits and legal action taken against Stripe. In 2020, for example, the Massachusetts attorney general found Stripe had facilitated payments for a fraudulent cryptocurrency operation due to subpar risk monitoring and fraud prevention systems. The companyagreed to pay $120,000and improve its fraud control and employee training. The letter also lists several lawsuits against the company alleging, among other things, that Stripe failed to ensure customer privacy and protect customer data.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/stripe-faces-bank-charter-pushback/806315/,,
How the open banking rule skidded,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said this month it cannot draw funding to continue operations when its current funds lapse, presenting the agency a number of challenges in formulating an open banking rule quickly. The CFPBtold a federal courtNov. 11 that the Justice Department had concluded that the bureau cannot “lawfully draw funds” from the Federal Reserve System – which Congress designated as its funding source – and that the agency has funds to operate until year’s end. The bureau’s notice did not specify what would happen then, although the CFPB’s acting director, Russ Vought, has assailed the agency in the past and spoke publicly in October about itsclosure within months. The bureau has been working on a new open banking rule since July, when it told a federal court it would “substantially”revise the ruleand was granted a litigation stay of a lawsuitfiled last yearby banking trade groups. The CFPB did not respond to an email Monday seeking comment on the rule. Last week, the bureau notified employees that it wouldtransfer its litigation workto the DOJ and planned additional furloughs at year’s end. In its motion for a stay, the bureau told U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves it planned “an accelerated rulemaking process” to address what it considered to be deficiencies with the prior rule, enacted under the Biden administration. But any proposed rule with significant changes – such as allowing financial institutions to charge fees for access to customers’ data – would also require the bureau to assess the impacts to small businesses under the federal Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, attorneys noted. At that point, a public comment period on the proposed rule – typically 30 to 90 days – would begin. The CFPB would then consider those comments and issue a final rule. However, the bureau is considering skipping some parts of the rulemaking process to issue a rule by year’s end, potentially including a public comment period on its proposed rule,Bloomberg Law reportedThursday, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. “Given the polarized view of these rules by the banking and FinTech sectors, if either constituency objects to the substance of the CFPB’s revisions, additional litigation could ensue,” an attorney with law firm McGlinchey Stafford, Adam Maarec, wrote in a Septemberalertabout the process. “An ‘accelerated rulemaking’ still takes a long time,” added Maarec, who advises fintechs and banks. The prior rule took CFPB staff four years from the rulemaking notice to a final rule, he noted, adding “the scope of issues here seems significantly narrower.” Banking groups that sued the bureau last year leaned heavily on the Administrative Procedure Act for their complaint, arguing that the agency had overstepped its authority to impose “a complicated, costly, and fundamentally insecure mandatory data-sharing framework” that did not allow banks to recover their costs. Last month, Reeves issued apreliminary injunctionpreventing the bureau from enforcing its rule, pending the revised rule the CFPB is formulating. A spokesperson for the Bank Policy Institute said Monday the organization understands that the bureau’s rulemaking process is moving forward but declined to comment further, directing other queries to the agency. The Financial Data and Technology Association, which counts data aggregators Plaid and Yodlee as members, said it continues to oppose any effort allowing banks to impose fees for customer data. Both Plaid and Yodlee have announced agreements with the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase, in the past two months that include new fees for data access. The Dodd-Frank Act does not permit fees, which are “a competitive toll on consumers simply for exercising their right to access and share their own financial information,” FDATA Executive Director Steve Boms said Monday in an emailed statement. “If banks are given the green light to impose those fees in a new rule, it would fundamentally shift control of financial data away from consumers and toward already powerful incumbents.” A spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association declined to comment Friday on the CFPB’s future or rule process, as did the American Fintech Council on Monday. Vought, who also leads the Office of Management and Budget, has been trying todramatically downsizethe CFPB’s workforce and mission since he was appointed acting director in February. “We don’t have anyone working there except our Republican appointees and a few career [employees] that are doing statutory responsibilities while weclose down the agency,” Vought said last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months.” Conservative lawmakers and interest groups have targeted the bureau since Congress formed it 15 years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. “The CFPB is a highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency. It is unconstitutional,” the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote in its “Project 2025Mandate for Leadership” document, in a chapter written by Robert Bowes, ahousing department officialin the first Trump administration and a former Chase Manhattan banking executive. “The next conservative President should order the immediate dissolution of the agency — pull down its prior rules, regulations and guidance, return its staff to their prior agencies and its building to the General Services Administration.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-open-banking-rule-skidded-fintechs-banks-vought-court/806436/,,
Ex-Truist employee sentenced in ‘complex’ check-cashing scheme,"A former Truist branch employee is one of eight Georgia residents sentenced in a counterfeit check-cashing scheme that involved stolen check information, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgiasaid Wednesday. The “complex” check-cashing and kickback scheme ran from at least November 2021 to December 2022, prosecutors said. At the time, Mariarlene Brown, aka “Mati Mom,” 44, of Valdosta, worked at a Truist branch in that city. In conspiring with Brown and others to commit bank fraud, William Allen Roberts, 27, of Valdosta, unlawfully obtained check information from Vincent Galliard, 41, of Sumter, South Carolina. Galliard was a former U.S. Postal Service employee in South Carolina who sold checks he stole from the mail, prosecutors said. Roberts used the check information provided by Galliard to produce fraudulent checks. Six others involved in the scheme recruited people to open Truist bank accounts and then got those people to provide their new Truist debit card and account information to those behind the scheme, “with the understanding that they would be paid for doing so,” prosecutors said. That group of co-conspirators included Frederick Pernell Green, 27; Thomas Christopher Mitchell, 31; Calvin Dewayne McKeithen, aka “Supa,” 26; Dewayne Rasheen Butler, aka “Guwapo,” 26; Tyler Khershad Jones, aka “LA Clippers,” 24; and Davontay Wiseman, aka “Vonn,” 28. Those six then passed the account information on to Roberts, who would write checks to those individuals in various amounts. Roberts, with Brown’s help, deposited checks into those accounts, and Brown made sure Roberts could withdraw cash from the accounts, according to prosecutors. Roberts paid Brown for her help in the scheme, as well as the co-conspirators and account holders, prosecutors said. Green, Roberts, Mitchell, McKeithen, Jones, Butler and Wiseman kept most of each check that was deposited, prosecutors said. Text messages the group members exchanged described the conspiracy, and investigators also discovered photos of debit cards, account numbers, fraudulent checks, cash obtained from the check deposits “and a custom-made diamond ring in the shape of the Truist logo worn by Green,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Brown was sentenced to 33 months in prison, five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $390,475.84 in restitution to Truist on Oct. 9, after she pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Seven others – all except Galliard – also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, were sentenced to prison time and ordered to pay Truist restitution in the same amount. Galliard pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a South Carolina case and was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison, along with five years of supervised release, prosecutors said. Galliard was ordered to pay $149,692.14 in restitution divided among The Citizens Bank, First Citizens Bank, South Atlantic Bank, TD Bank, The Conway National Bank and Bank of America, according toa court filing. “Individuals who participate in check-cashing and kickback schemes will face imprisonment and other penalties,” U.S. Attorney Will Keyes said in the press release. “Investigators from the Secret Service and the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office worked to unravel this criminal network, ultimately preventing further theft and helping us ensure accountability for the defendants.” Bank regulators seek to bolster their efforts to address check fraud, which has grown “substantially” in the past several years, Michelle Bowman, the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision,said in June. Although check use has dropped, check fraud hasn’t diminished in tandem. “Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of real or attempted check fraud transactions grew nearly fourfold, even as the number of checks paid fell by more than 18 percent from 2018 to 2021,”the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantareported this year.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ex-truist-employee-sentenced-check-cashing-scheme/806169/,,
Citi CFO Mark Mason to step down in March,"Citi CFO Mark Mason, arguably the highest-profile Black executive at a U.S.-based global systemically important financial institution, will step down from his role in early March, the bankannounced Thursday. At that point, Gonzalo Luchetti, now the bank’s head of U.S. personal banking, will become CFO. Mason, meanwhile, will transition to executive vice chair and senior executive adviser to Citi CEO Jane Fraser, but he intends to pursue leadership opportunities outside the bank by the end of 2026, according to the announcement. In his adviser role, Mason will help Citi prepare for its investor day May 7 and give guidance on the bank’s strategic initiatives. Mason has been a key figure in Citi’stwo-year reorganization, in which the bank set out to simplify its structure,trim its headcount by 20,000employees by 2026, and embrace tech modernization meant to free it fromtwo 2020 consent orders. Citi launched further reorganization Thursday, saying it would integrate its retail bank into its wealth business. The move arguably hands more responsibility to wealth chief Andy Sieg. The bank’s U.S. Everyday Banking, Citi Priority, Citigold and Citigold Private Client labels will be consolidated into a single group led by Kate Luft. Luft, who has served as head of U.S. retail bankingsince April, will add “and Citigold” to her title and report to Sieg. With the move, “U.S. Personal Banking” will no longer be one of Citi’s five core businesses, the company said. But it will be replaced by “U.S. Consumer Cards,” which will combine the bank’s branded cards and retail services businesses under Pam Habner. Habner, who has served as Citi’s head of branded cards and lendingsince 2020, will join the bank’s executive management team and report directly to Fraser. “This evolution of our leadership team and structure is well timed as it puts in place our next generation of leaders ahead of our upcoming Investor Day, when we will lay out our plans to further grow our returns,” Fraser said Thursday in a statement. “We are ending the year with momentum and confidence.” Mason’s upcoming transition comes less than a month after Citi threw added support behind Fraser,naming her chairand giving her a $25 million equity award meant to keep her in place for years to come. Fraser on Thursday called Mason “an invaluable partner” who “models integrity, drive and commitment no matter the circumstances, and has always put the firm first.” “Mark has proven himself to be a leader for all seasons, having helped Citi navigate some of our most challenging times and being a driving force behind the results we are now seeing in our performance and our Transformation,” Fraser said, citing the capitalized term the bank gives its tech modernization. Mason joined Citi in 2001 and has been CFO since 2019 – but between those benchmarks has served as CEO of Citi’s private bank, CEO of Citi Holdings, and CFO of the bank’s Institutional Clients Group, according to hisLinkedIn profile. “Serving as CFO for the last seven years and contributing to a leadership team that is redefining expectations for Citi stands as one of the most demanding and fulfilling chapters of my career,” Mason said in a statement Thursday. “I know that Gonzalo will work tirelessly with the strong team we’ve built across Finance to further Citi’s momentum, and I am fully committed to his smooth transition into the new role.” Scott Siefers, a managing director and senior research analyst for Piper Sandler, called Mason’s departure “an unfortunate loss” for Citi. “Thankfully, he will be succeeded by an insider with deep experience,” Siefers wrote in a note seen by Banking Dive. Luchetti joined Citi in 2006 and has served, among other roles, as consumer banking chief for Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and as global head of wealth management and insurance, according to hisLinkedIn profile. He became head of U.S. personal banking in 2021 and on Thursday earned plaudits from Fraser for expanding his segment’s return on tangible common equity to 14.5% for 2025’s third quarter. “I knew exactly what we needed in our next CFO to build on Mark’s successful tenure,” Fraser said. “In addition to the table-stakes requirement of superb financial acumen, it must be someone who is strategically minded, data-driven, analytical, and an excellent operator. … Gonzalo is that person.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-mark-mason-cfo-step-down-march-gonzalo-luchetti-fraser-sieg-luft-habner/806137/,,
Wells Fargo taps Saul Van Beurden to scale AI,"Saul Van Beurden, chief executive of Wells Fargo consumer and small business banking,has been tappedto scale artificial intelligence at the bank, the lender said Thursday. Additionally, the bank’s CEO for consumer lending, Kleber Santos, will take on added responsibilities as co-CEO of consumer lending and banking as Wells formally combines the businesses, allowing Van Beurden to focus more on AI. “Generative and agentic AI will reshape competitive dynamics across every industry, and we are embracing these tools as we have embraced robotic process automation and machine learning for years,” Wells CEO Charlie Scharf said in a prepared statement. In August, Wells gave branch bankers, investment bankers, customer relations and corporate teamsaccess to AI agents and toolsfrom Google Cloud. The tools help employees sort through massive loads of documentation and provide real-time market insights, among other things. Wells is among banks in a near-ubiquitous industry pushtoward AI-fueled efficiencies. Wells has trained some 90,000 employees on AI this year, deployed AI tools to many others and is now broadening its uses, Scharf said. “Our employees and customers have powerful models in their hands. They expect the same at work,” Van Beurden toldForbesthis month on AI. “GenAI helps remove simple repetitive tasks, builds workflows and frees people to do higher-value work. We are scratching the surface.” The key is to deploy AI in ways that “enhance human performance rather than replace it,” he told Forbes. In his enhanced role, Van Beurden will help leaders in Wells’ businesses oversee transformation in their own segments, Scharf said in a prepared statement. “Success will be driven by business heads embracing these new technologies and rethinking their own operating models using generative and agentic AI solutions,” Scharf said. The advances in AI, he added, “have given us a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform how we work and we are excited by what we can deliver for our employees, customers and communities.” Van Beurden joined Wells in2019 from JPMorgan Chase, where he was chief information officer of consumer and community banking. The San Francisco-based bankelevated him in 2023from head of technology to CEO of consumer and small-business banking.

CFPB is transferring its cases to DOJ,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is transferring all of its active litigation to the Justice Department, according to separate statements Thursday from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, and the workers union representing the agency. Further, Mike Salemi, the CFPB’s acting enforcement chief, said at an all-hands meeting Thursday that, as he understood it, all bureau employees would be furloughed at the end of the year,Government Executivereported, citing people familiar with the matter. Salemi hedged, saying he was not privy to all of the plans, but that the information came from an associate general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget who also serves as a senior legal adviser at the CFPB. The timeline, if true, would dovetail with a projection CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought made in a podcast appearance last month, when he said the only employees left at the bureau were “our Republican appointees and a few career [staff] that are doing statutory responsibilities while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the nexttwo, three months,” Vought said. Further, DOJ attorneys filed paperwork last week with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, indicating the CFPB “anticipates exhaustingits currently available funds in early 2026.” The filing was meant to flag a “potential lapse in appropriations” to pay the bureau’s operating expenses. The court this year granted apreliminary injunctionpreventing the CFPB from firing the vast majority of its staff. Included in the filing was a memo the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel sent Vought, asserting that the bureau may not legally request funds at this time from the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. Salemi on Thursday said the 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation, according to Government Executive. A few top officials may have the opportunity to work for DOJ,American Bankerreported, citing people who were part of the all-hands call. Salemi noted that the DOJ stood up an enforcement and affirmative litigation unit within its Civil Division in September. Salemi told CFPB staff he assumed the agency’s work would be routed there beginning in 2026, according to Government Executive. Cat Farman, president of the National Treasury Employees Union 335, which represents CFPB employees, said Vought has “no legal authority” to transfer the bureau’s cases to the DOJ. “This is Russ Vought’s latest illegal power grab in his ongoing plan to shut down the CFPB,” Farman said in a statement on theNTEU’s website. However, the Dodd-Frank Act indicates the DOJ has the authority to handle cases where no agency is designated to do so by law,Bloomberg Lawreported. Before the CFPB was established in 2011, the DOJ took cases under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act because no other agency had the power. The CFPB is still litigating 13 cases, Farman said, though Vought this year has dismissed 22 enforcement actions brought by the bureau under previous administrations. “CFPB attorneys are afraid DOJ will dismiss [the remaining] cases,” Farman said. The DOJ declined to comment. The CFPB didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Warren, the senator credited as the architect of the bureau, appeared to hold tight to her suspicions. “Donald Trump and Russ Vought are racing to shut down the CFPB while their lawyers tell the courts the opposite,”Warren wrotein a statement Thursday. “Nobody is fooled about the Trump-Vought end game, and the courts must uphold the law.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-transfer-litigation-doj-enforcement-furloughs-salemi-vought/806193/,,
"TD illegally targeted, fired Chinese-heritage employees: lawsuit","Five former TD Bank employees of Chinese heritage say the bank illegally fired them in the wake of TD’s fentanyl-tied money laundering scandal,court documents show. Plaintiffs Andrew Wong, Ka Po Wong, Anne Louie, April Ng and Millie Su allege that TD “intentionally targeted and disproportionately impacted the bank’s Chinese and Chinese American employees” to placate investigators as they probed the lender’santi-money laundering control issues, and to “give the appearance of robust AML procedures.” The bank’s “robust enforcement” went “far beyond the normal scope” in investigating the employees’ personal transaction histories, particularly cash exchanges that moved through their bank accounts, the plaintiffs said. Chinese families traditionally borrow money from family and friends, rather than banks, and it’s common for family members to gift funds for large purchases, such as a house, plaintiffs said, citing a “financial culture [that] is prevalent in the Chinese diaspora, including the Chinese-American community.” The investigators did not take that into account, the plaintiffs asserted. In one instance, investigators pressed Ng on a $500 transaction in new bills meant as a gift during Chinese New Year, a custom. In another, investigators questioned Su about $15,000 in cash she received from family members. The funds, intended as a house down payment gift to a family associate, were deposited into Su’s account. She added $5,000 from her account, and wrote the associate a $20,000 check. “The targeted Chinese and Chinese American employees provided proof that transactions questioned by TD were legitimate, yet each still suffered the most severe adverse employment action possible. They were terminated,” plaintiffs allege. “More callously, the terminated Chinese and Chinese American were demarketed from TD Bank. TD closed their personal and business accounts, and, upon information and belief, barred them from banking with TD in the future.” Prior to the fentanyl-tied AML investigation, TD “leveraged the national origin of its Chinese and Chinese American employees to foster trust in the Chinese community and build their business,” plaintiffs said. During the investigation, however, TD’s Chinese and Chinese American employees “were then targeted by the bank because of their ethnicity and national origin. They were punished for crimes committed by other Chinese individuals — crimes they were not involved in by individuals they did not know.” “Their Chinese heritage, once used by TD Bank to garner trust in the Chinese community, now became a target for TD,” plaintiffs said. Due to TD’s investigations of its Chinese and Chinese American employees in the New York City’s Chinatown branches alone, at least 22 employees were terminated or subject to adverse employment actions, the lawsuit asserted. All but one of the terminated employees were of Chinese origin. At least one employee was terminated for a transaction with a Chinese American employee, according to court documents. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement at their respective jobs, back pay and emotional damages sustained as a result of TD’s conduct. A TD spokesperson told Banking Dive that the bank has no comment, given that the litigation is pending. Arthur Schwartz, an attorney for the plaintiffs, did not respond to a request for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/td-illegally-targeted-fired-chinese-heritage-employees-lawsuit/806066/,,

Capital One joins FedNow,"Capital One joined the Federal Reserve’s instant payments system FedNow this week, leaving Bank of America and Truist among the major U.S. financial institutions not participating in that real-time ecosystem. Capital One started its FedNow participation Tuesday, a spokesperson for the bank said by email. “Financial Institutions of all sizes are rapidly enabling instant payments for their accountholders,” U.S. Faster Payments Council CEO Reed Luhtanen said by email, when asked for comment on how the system is developing. “The ability to offer instant money movement is becoming table stakes in our 21st century economy, and financial institutions that don’t have a faster payments strategy need to develop one, and fast.” A spokesperson for Bank of America didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson confirmed late last month that the bank had not yet joined FedNow. FedNow has attracted all but two of theeight biggest U.S. retail banks, according to a list of participants on theFederal Reserve’s FedNow website. The service allows for the transfer of payments between banks in seconds or minutes, as opposed to some alternatives that take days. While about 1,550 U.S. financial institutions have joined the FedNow system since itlaunched in July 2023, there are thousands that have not, despite the central bank’s efforts to attract smaller banks as well. In all, there are about 9,000 U.S. financial institutions, including large banks, smaller regional and community banks, and credit unions. (Only U.S. financial institutions are allowed to connect to the FedNow system.) Nonetheless, the large banks are the most active in the payments sphere. The 50 biggest banks operating in the U.S. account for more than 90% of payment originations on the major clearing systems operated by The Clearing House andNacha, based on those organizations’ statistics. To smooth the way to joining the system, the Fed is trying to make it as easy as possible. Currently, the “record” time period for onboarding a bank — from signing a contract with the central bank to offering services — is seven days, FedNow Chief Executive Nick Stanescusaid in a video poston FedNow’s website Tuesday. He noted there are also 41 certified service providers that aid in bringing bank clients to the system. To boost transaction volume, FedNow has been gradually increasing the maximum amount that can be sent over the system.

Lloyds to buy UK fintech Curve,"London-based Lloyds Bank will buy theU.K. fintech Curve, the bankannounced Wednesday. Lloyds did not disclose the price point for the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2026. But the acquisition lends credence to aSky Newsreport from last week, indicating the bank would pay £120 million for the digital wallet provider. That’s less than half the £250 million in funding Curve is said to have raised since its founding in 2015. And it’s far below the valuation CEO Shachar Bialick had targeted for the company. “In ten years’ time we are going to be IPO-ed … and hopefully worth around $50 billion to $60 billion,” Bialick, a former Israeli special forces soldier, toldThe Times of Londonin 2019, using the acronym for initial public offering. In a circular to investors last week, Curve said it “share[s] the disappointment some of you may have in this outcome.” “We recognize that the value of this transaction falls short of the ambitions we all held for Curve,” the company said in the note, seen by Sky News. “Yet, the board strongly believes this transaction represents the best available path forward for Curve's creditors and shareholders as a whole."" However, IDC Ventures, an investor that holds a 12% stake in Curve, said in a statement Friday it is ""deeply concerned about the conduct of Curve's management and board during the current sale process."" IDC alleged a small group of directors and investors at Curve “facilitated corporate decision-making to entrench control and override shareholder rights,” adding that “issues regarding [Curve’s] governance and ownership are disputed.” The investor sought toremove Curve's chairin September, but the effort failed. IDC has consistently opposed a sale to Lloyds since rumors of a potential transaction became public in July. The investor wrote “repeatedly” to Curve and its board, opposing the sale, “without receiving any meaningful response or engagement,” it asserted in September. IDC also said it wrote to Lloyds, but the bank did not respond. “It is a matter of real surprise to shareholders that Lloyds Banking Group, a leading UK institution, would contemplate proceeding with a transaction that IDC believes is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders,” IDC wrote Friday, adding it “does not believe” a sale could be “implemented” without the investor’s support. Curve’s auditors earlier this year had warned of “material uncertainty” at the firm, according toCityAM. Financial figures published in March revealed the company had paused its plans to expand to the U.S. and, in 2023, cut about a third of its workforce, according totech.eu. Curve reported a pretax loss of £36 million in 2023, up from £69 million the year before. Bialick, when asked if Curve would be profitable in 2024, said the company’s “priority is sustainable expansion, and we anticipate reaching break-even in the near term.” Curve touts a digital wallet platform that brings all of a user’s cards and alternative payment sources into one place, while offering payment flexibility, real-time spend insights and no foreign exchange fees. In a statement onCurve’s blog Wednesday, Bialick said Curve’s “mission” has always been to “simplify and supercharge people’s finances.” “Joining forces with Lloyds Banking Group means we can now scale that vision faster, helping tens of millions more customers unlock smarter payments, and empower greater financial accessibility,” he said. Curve, on its own, counts 6 million customers. Lloyds, by comparison, reaches 28 million. The bank announced in January it planned toclose 136 branchesin the U.K. as customers rely more heavily on digital banking. Buying a digital wallet platform, presumably, would dovetail with that vision. “Building on the innovative changes we’ve made to our app recently, integrating Curve’s cutting-edge technology and digital wallet capabilities will deliver a next-generation digital banking experience for our customers as we help them to take control of their finances in a simple and convenient way,” Jas Singh, CEO of consumer relationships at Lloyds, said in a release Wednesday. Lloyds said Wednesday the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the bank, or to affect full-year guidance for 2025 or 2026.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/lloyds-bank-uk-acquire-fintech-curve-digital-wallet-120-million-idc-investor-concern/806065/,,
NY AG’s office scrutinizes SoLo Funds,"Fintech lender SoLo Funds is engaged with the New York attorney general’s office related to usury concerns, an executive said this week. Denzel Singletary, head of government affairs and strategic partnerships at the company, said SoLo Funds was served a subpoena this year by state AG Letitia James’ office. “We're in negotiations with them now, figuring out … what common ground looks like,” Singletary said, speaking Monday at the Banking Transformation Summit in Charlotte, North Carolina, on the topic of fintechs and regulators working together. James’ office declined to comment Tuesday. After SoLo Funds was subpoenaed, “my job initially was to make sure New York knew that we were not working in a nefarious way,” Singletary said. He said he highlighted the fintech’s community platform and tried to dispel misconceptions customers are being charged exorbitant interest rates. SoLo Funds bills itself as a community finance platform. Its business model has drawn the attention of regulators in a handful of states who view its “tip” structure asa predatory lending practice. In recent years, SoLo hasreached agreements with regulatorsin California, Washington, D.C., Connecticut and Pennsylvania related toallegations borrowers were required to pay large “tips” to access loans through its platform. In May 2024,the Los Angeles-based fintech was suedby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau,then under the Biden administration, also took issue with SoLo’s “tip” structure, which it said obscured the total cost of loans. The CFPB also said SoLo, which marketed itself as a consumer-friendly alternative to pricier, short-term loans, hid from borrowers the option to forgo a tip, and offered loans to borrowers in states that require platforms to have a license. SoLo said it had long since changed some components of its display the CFPB called out in the lawsuit. In February, under the Trump administration, the CFPBdropped the lawsuitagainst SoLo Funds. Russ Vought, the CFPB’s acting director who also leads the OMB, said at the time that the bureau under former director Rohit Chopra “shockingly” tried to “destroy” SoLo, “which incurred millions in legal fees and had to lay off 30% of its workforce.” “It was wrong and we dismissed the case,” Vought said. Prior tojoining SoLo Funds in 2024, Singletary was the director of U.S. government affairs at investing fintech Robinhood. “When SoLo Funds reached out to me to come and work with them,” he said, “it was this opportunity of figuring out, how do I make this fintech work well with regulators? What can I do to strengthen this relationship with this particular fintech and regulators?” That task was made far more difficult when, two weeks after he joined SoLo Funds, the firm was sued by the CFPB. He called that “a very interesting intro into the company,” but said he wasn’t deterred in seeking to make sure the regulator and the fintech understood each other. Then came a “blessing” in the form of the presidential administration change in January, Singletary said. “It was an opportunity for us to state our case in front of a new body, really,” he said. In doing that, the fintech focused on its community of users. “What does this whole community look like? What is this application actually doing? Who is it actually helping?” he said. “The customers are always going to make it make sense for the regulators,” he said. “I highlighted the fact that even though there's misconceptions, that we were facing those and actually working through them.” SoLo Funds became the first company to have a lawsuit dismissed by the current CFPB, which has since dropped a number of lawsuits filed under the Biden administration. “I genuinely think that's because we highlighted the community,” Singletary said. “Bodies really matter” when it comes to cooperation between fintechs and regulators. As the CFPB has reversed course on a number of actions, James has been quick to pick up the mantle in New York. Her officesued Capital Oneover lost interest payments to consumers andsued Early Warningover alleged fraud at Zelle – and initiated both after the CFPB dropped similar lawsuits this year. James’ office has also filed lawsuits against earned wage access providersMoneyLion and DailyPay, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to thousands of workers. Travis Holoway and Rodney Williams, the founders of SoLo Funds, soughtto establish an alternative to costly payday lenders, Singletary said. They“were two college-educated men who had made it, and their friends and family were consistently asking them for loans,” Singletary said. SoLo Funds, which launched in 2018, offers checking accounts and debit cards, and through its loan marketplace, members can request loans that other users can fund. The fintech – which taps Bangor Savings Bank for banking services – has about 2 million customers and 1.8 million deposit accounts, and has facilitated about $1 billion in transactions, Singletary said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ny-ag-james-solo-funds-tips-cfpb-fintech-regulators/806024/,,
Senators back open banking rule,"Several Senate Democrats on Thursday called on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to keep pursuing open banking rules that give consumers the ability to easily shift their personal data from one financial institution to another. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut pressed CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought in a letter seen by Payments Dive to continue the federal agency’s work in writing a rule under the Dodd-Frank Act that would further such consumer rights, without fees. The agency issued such a rule last year during the Biden administration, but bank trade groups sued over the regulation and it has been tied up in court. Under Vought’s leadership, the agency stopped backing the Biden-era rule in the litigation, which a judge has stayed, pending the agency’s decision to rewrite the rule. At the same time, Vought is aggressively shrinking the agency and threatening to shutter it, leaving the rule’s future in doubt. “We are concerned that the Trump CFPB’s policymaking seems to be more driven by the seesawing interests of big banks and other industry groups than with protecting consumers’ rights to their own data, as mandated by law,” the senators wrote in their letter. The senators alsoissued a press releaseThursday, insisting Vought reinstate the priorPersonal Financial Data Rights rule. “In the absence of the rule, big banks have demonstrated that they intend to charge exorbitant fees for this data to choke off competition and concentrate this data in the hands of a few large incumbents,” the senators wrote. The senators also contended that banks should not be allowed to charge for access to the data, saying it would be a violation of the law. “Large financial institutions have a monopoly over large swaths of consumer data and thus have the potential to drive out competitors and start ups in the data sharing market,” the letter said. The senators specifically called out JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, for imposing fees this year on third-party data aggregators, including the fintech Plaid. That bank’s fees were “at rates high enough to paralyze the market,” the letter said, noting that PayPal’s peer-to-peer payment tool Venmo and neobank Chime use Plaid to connect users’ bank accounts to their apps. JPMorgan Chase was set to impose an estimated $300 million in new fees annually on Plaid, the senators said, citing an article from Forbes, before the companies reached an agreement in September on terms that weren’t disclosed. JPMorgan Chase’s initial fee structure “indicates where the market may be moving absent the CFPB’s rule,” the letter said. A second data aggregator, Yodlee, this month said it had reached anupdated agreementwith JPMorgan Chase over access fees. The senators argued that “it is critical that any revisions the CFPB makes to the Personal Financial Data Rights rule recognize the importance of consumers being able to exercise their rights, which includes deciding how and by whom their data is used.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/open-banking-cfpb-warren-wyden-blumenthal-vought-jpmorgan-plaid-chime-venmo-yodlee/806190/,,
Florida credit union to buy Georgia bank,"Jacksonville, Florida-based Community First Credit Union of Florida will buy Waycross, Georgia-based First Southern Bank, creating a $3.3 billion-asset institution, thecredit union announced Tuesday. The deal, which would extend the credit union’s footprint into southeast Georgia and elsewhere into Florida, is thesecond CU-bank tie-up announced this week,after El Paso, Texas-based GECU proposed buying Roswell, New Mexico-based Bank of the Southwest on Monday. “While we love the growth opportunities that come with the transaction, this acquisition is founded on a unified vision between Community First and First Southern Bank,” Sam Inman, CEO of Community First, said in a prepared statement. “Both institutions emphasize a community-oriented and relationship-based approach, maintaining a culture that respects individuals and prioritizes service excellence.” Both institutions are storied: Community First is 90 years old. First Southern is 118 years old. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both institutions, is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2026. After that, First Southern’s holding company will liquidate, dissolve and distribute any remaining assets to its stockholders. The new Community First will count roughly $2.5 billion in loans and $2.9 billion in deposits across 31 branches. “First Southern Bank customers will continue to see their trusted familiar banker at each location,” said First Southern CEO Daniel Hager in a prepared statement. “The newly combined institution will have the ability to offer highly personalized financial services, which will enable us the financial capabilities to support further expansion.” Community First plans to retain all First Southern employees, stretching its headcount to 530. “Combining will expand services and strengthen community impact,” Community First said in a Q&A on its website. Tie-ups between credit unions and banks are not without challengers.Independent Community Bankers of America CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey released a statement Tuesday calling for policymakers “to address the harmful impact these deals have on local communities.” CitingICBA data, Rainey said the deals harm “small businesses and local communities while community banks outperform credit unions in high-poverty areas.” She called for Congress to eliminate the federal tax exemption for credit unions with more than $1 billion in assets. More than 80% of deals since 2010 have involved credit unions of that size, ICBA found. Four in 10 deals have involved a credit union headquartered in a different state than the acquired bank. Small Business Administration lending fell almost 80% at community banks that were acquired by credit unions, according to ICBA, and the amount loaned per approved mortgage application at the institutions decreased 61%. Michael Bell, a partner at Honigman who often architects such deals – including this one – told Banking Dive that ICBA’s statements are without “substance.” “The ICBA equates size to evil for some reason,” he said. “I ask the ICBA, is a $1 billion community bank still a community bank? Should all community banks larger than $1 billion give up the many tax subsidies enjoyed by community banks?”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/florida-credit-union-buy-georgia-bank/805897/,,
White House nominates Vought aide to lead CFPB,"Additionally, Geof Gradler was named deputy director of the CFPB. He’s a former lobbyist who joined the bureau about four months ago, according tohis LinkedIn profile. The CFPB spokesperson declined to comment on the fate of the agency, or whether the bureau intended to make a similar move in another 210 days. Vought said last monthon a podcast that onlyRepublican appointees and a few career employees remain “while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months,” Vought said. Trump administration officials have tried repeatedly this yearto hobble or shutterthe agency but have, at times run into court-ordered roadblocks. The CFPB spokesperson said the hearing process likely will be a moot point for Levenbach. The Senate probably wouldn’t get around to it until next year, the spokesperson said, and with Vought not going anywhere, the formal process may not occur. Michael Emancipator, senior vice president and regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America,noted on LinkedInWednesday that Levenbach’s nomination appears to be “merely a resetting of the clock” under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. And McGuireWoods partner Jeff Ehrlich, a former deputy enforcement director at the CFPB, said the nomination is “likely a placeholder,” according toa LinkedIn post. The spokesperson pointed toa news releasethe bureau issued last week, in which the CFPB said itinformed the court inNTEU v. Voughtthat the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the CFPBcan’t legally request fundsfrom the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB “anticipates having sufficient funds to continue operations until at least December 31,” the release said.DOJ attorneys told the court that available funds are expected to run out in early 2026. Levenbach is also vice chair of theNational Capital Planning Commission, a panel that Voughtthreatened to involvein this summer’s dust-up over an over-budget renovation at the Federal Reserve. Levenbach served as chief of staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during Trump’s first term. Later, he became a senior adviser with the White House National Economic Council and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, according tohis LinkedIn profile. Prior to those roles, he spent about a decade at OMB. “Donald Trump’s sending the Senate a new nominee to lead the CFPB looks like nothing more than a front for Russ Vought to stay on as Acting Director indefinitely as he tries to illegally close down the agency,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a Wednesday statement. “Instead of doing everything in their power to lower costs for Americans, Trump and Vought want to make it easier for giant corporations to scam families out of their money.” Consumer Bankers Association CEO Lindsey Johnson said Levenbach’s nomination “comes at a critical time for consumers and the financial services marketplace.” “America’s leading Main Street banks look forward to continuing to work with the Trump Administration on data-driven, pro-growth policies that will support hardworking Americans and drive the economy forward, while at the same time ensuring the Bureau fulfills its statutory mission and sticks to what Congress authorized it to do,” she said in a Wednesday statement. “This will not only help restore the trust and credibility of the CFPB, but will benefit consumers, industry, and the broader economy alike.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-director-levenbach-vought-omb-trump/805913/,,
LevelField gets state approval to buy Chicago bank,"LevelField filed a fresh application to buy Burling inDecember 2024. In that paperwork, the Houston firm said it would pay roughly $70 million for the bank, which counts a single branch and $209.5 million in assets. The combined entity will be renamed LevelField Bank but maintain Burling’s community banking business. However, it will add a focus on deposit accounts, loans and custody services tailored to digital assets, including term loans and credit cards secured by bitcoin or Ether, according to the application. Burling's CEO, Michael Busch, will become president of LevelField Bank, Grant said. From the beginning, LevelField said it sought to become the first full-service chartered bank to offer traditional banking and digital asset services on one platform across the U.S. ""The idea is, once we have a customer, they don't have to go outside the bank perimeter for anything they want to do in digital assets,” Grant told American Banker. Grant said he expects acquisition to be finalized by the end of this year. Only Burling’s cannabis banking business will retain the Burling brand, LevelField said. To accommodate the anticipated round-the clock needs of its digital-asset user base, LevelField aims to hire roughly 100 employees in 2026 – mostly in customer service, Grant said. Once LevelField receives regulatory approval, it aims to raise $112.5 million, according to its December 2024 filing. That is meant to cover the acquisition of the bank, $20 million in growth capital and $17.5 million that LevelField will retain, the company said. In a release Monday, Grant thanked investors “for backing the patient, disciplined work it took to meet the necessary supervisory standards that protect consumers and businesses and make the U.S. the home of the world leading banking system."" As far as embracing crypto, Grant said the banking system can either ""live in denial or we can try to safely integrate it … in such a way that it works collaboratively and doesn't endanger the system."" “Financial services must be changed from the inside, and unlike other industries, outside disruptors barely move the needle,” Granttold Bloomberg.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/levelfield-acquire-burling-bank-illinois-regulator-approval-crypto-digital-asset/805947/,,
FDIC countersues Capital One over special assessment,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. accused Capital One of paying $99.4 million less than necessary to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund following the 2023 failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, according tocourt documents filed Monday. The FDIC’s lawsuit countered legal action takenin Septemberagainst the regulator by the bank, which alleged the FDICimposed an “outsized and improperly calculated” special assessment fee on Capital One. The FDIC inflated its assessment against Capital One by $149.2 million, the bank said in September. At issue is a $56 billion position between two Capital One subsidiaries which, according to Monday’s lawsuit, Capital One excluded in its reporting of uninsured deposits. Capital One said the agency “erroneously” included the position as uninsured deposits, inflating what the bank owed. The FDIC used funds from the DIF to protect uninsured depositors when banks fail. When SVB and Signature Bank were seized by the FDIC in March 2023, most of their deposits – 88% and 67%, respectively – were above the FDIC’s $250,000 threshold and “uninsured.” To recoup DIF funds later that year, the FDIC implemented a special assessment on the nation’s largest banks, including Capital One. The FDIC argued Monday that Capital One benefits from deposit insurance, and that the funds were “deposits held at the bank for which the subsidiary already received the benefit of FDIC deposit insurance.” ""There are no time machines when it comes to special assessments,” the FDIC said. Capital One and the FDIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fdic-countersues-capital-one-over-special-assessment/805937/,,
JPMorgan Chase enhancing due diligence for clients in the Amazon region,"The change itself does not come with any inherent restrictions on client activities or transactions in the region, but a JPMorgan spokesperson told ESG Dive on Wednesday that each activity and transaction will be considered “on a case-by-case basis, in line with [its] risk appetite and commercial interests.” “Managing risk is critical to the long-term success of our business,” the bank’s spokesperson said in emailed comments. “We added Amazon Biome as one example of a business location associated with clients and/or transactions we consider sensitive or in need of enhanced review, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.” The RAISG geospatial definition, which JPMorgan will use to define the biome, “is widely recommended by Indigenous leaders and activists,” according to Stand.earth. Allison Fajans-Turner, a senior campaigner at the Rainforest Action Network — one of the environmental organizations backing the annual Banking on Climate Chaos reports — said requiring enhanced due diligence for activities in the Amazon biome is “the bare minimum that we should expect from other large backers of Amazon drilling.” “JPMorgan Chase has finally taken an essential — if long-overdue — step to confront its role as the largest financier of oil and gas extraction in the Amazon,” Fajans-Turner said in Stand.earth’s Nov. 13 release. After 30% of JPMorgan’s shareholders supported a proposal to require the bank to issue a report on its practices on Indigenous People's rights in the 2024 proxy season, JPMorgan reached an agreement with shareholders proposing a similar filing in the most recent proxy season. The United Church Fundwithdrew its proposal to the bankin April — afterJPMorgan submitted a no-action requeston the filing — once the bank agreed to add a disclosure stating “the company will consider free, prior and informed consent where risks are identified before proceeding with transactions that may have material implications for Indigenous Peoples.” “Promises on paper to respect Indigenous and human rights and screen clients operating in the Amazon biome fall far short of what’s needed: real financing exclusions applied to the Amazon and other fragile ecosystems and rigorous implementation of human rights protections for Indigenous peoples and all affected local communities,” Fajans-Turner said in the Nov. 13 release. In addition to the Arctic and the Amazon, JPMorgan requires a case-by-case enhanced review for coal mining and coal-fired power activities; clients whose “main business is the physical trading of conflict minerals,” cobalt or diamond trading; and hydropower, agricultural commodities or downstream agricultural commodity use in non-designated countries.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-enhancing-due-diligence-amazon-region-clients-standearth/806007/,,
Investor blasts Comerica over Fifth Third deal,"Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management on Monday probed Comerica’s $10.9 billion deal to be acquired by Fifth Third and threatened legal action against the bank if more information on the deal process isn’t released. Additionally, Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions was Comerica’s first suitor, before the Dallas-based bank struck a deal with Fifth Third,American Bankerreported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Spokespeople for Regions and Fifth Third declined to comment. A Comerica spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July,accusing the regional lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” HoldCo, whichowns about 2.04 million shares of Comerica stock,suggested PNC, Fifth Third or Huntington as possible buyers. In October, Fifth Third said it wasacquiring Comerica for $10.9 billionin stock. Earlier this month,a regulatory filingrevealed that the Cincinnati-based lender was not Comerica’s first suitor. The CEO of another bank, identified as Financial Institution A in the filing, proposed an all-stock transaction with $78 billion-asset Comerica in September. But Comerica’s board determined the terms “were not likely to be more attractive than the consideration that could be offered by another counterparty.” HoldCo’s65-page presentation issued Monday, which parsed recent regulatory filings, alleged a lack of board oversight in Comerica CEO Curt Farmer’s interactions with Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence and the absence of a competitive process in the Fifth Third deal, saying “this isn’t negotiation; it’s surrender.” HoldCo accused Comerica’s board of ignoring Financial Institution A’s proposals, a choice it called “indefensible,” and contended “had you engaged, we believe those ‘preliminary’ bids would have matured into definitive proposals — at likely materially higher levels.” HoldCo also critiqued Farmer’s “windfall” – he’s set to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks – and the deal’s “aggressive” breakup fee of $500 million. The acquisition is set to face a shareholder vote in January. HoldCo demanded a raft of details, calling on Comerica to “provide a more complete and transparent chronology of the events leading up to the Fifth Third transaction.” That includes when the board first discussed potential responses to shareholder pressure and when it authorized Comerica management to explore a merger, as well as information on the identity of Financial Institution A, the timing, substance and financial terms of its proposals, and whether Comerica or its advisers engaged with that bank. “The apparent absence of any follow-up engagement with a bidder who made an offer — combined with the lack of evidence that J.P. Morgan sought to create competition between bidders — suggests a process engineered to favor Fifth Third rather than one designed to maximize shareholder value,” the activist investor said. HoldCo also pressed for details on the decision to hire JPMorgan Chase as Comerica’s financial adviser, and seeks more specifics related to Farmer’s conversations with Spence. “The size and timing of Mr. Farmer’s compensation package strongly indicate a potential conflict of interest — namely, that Fifth Third effectively ‘overpaid’ the CEO to secure a lower purchase price for shareholders,” the activist said. If the bank doesn’t provide the requested detail, “we will have to consider seeking expedited relief in the Delaware Court of Chancery to obtain the disclosures we believe are warranted,” HoldCo said. The activist may also consider bringing fiduciary-duty claims in the Delaware court. In recent months, Regions executives have repeatedly expressed disinterest in acquiring a bank, instead eyeing the opportunity to snag customers and talentamid disruption caused by other M&Aactivity. Regions CFO David Turner reiterated those views this month at theBancAnalysts Association of Boston conference– which would have been after the bank reportedly proposed a deal with Comerica. “We're, I think, the only bank that hadn't done an acquisition since 2006,” Turner said Nov. 7. The bank had just finished its strategic plan, “and M&A is not part of that plan,” he said. “It's just not part of where we want to focus our time and attention. And we understand things can change, but that's just not where we are today,” Turner added. Still, one analyst noted some wonder whether the bank’s position may change. “With increased M&A activity in their Southeast backyard, there have been investors who wonder if [Regions management] would start to feel compelled to take part in the M&A wave, particularly since the company is profitable but has had challenges growing organically,” Truist Securities analyst Brian Finneran wrote in a Tuesday note.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/holdco-activist-comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-regions/805807/,,
Revolut valued at $75B,"Revolut is valued at $75 billion after completing a share sale, theBritish fintech said Monday. Revolut did not disclose how many shares were sold or the amount raised. It’s the fifth share sale Revolut has allowed its staff to date, with the fintech asserting it’s “one of the most liquid employee share programmes across private companies in the industry.” The new valuation marks significant growth sinceRevolut’s $45 billion valuation 15 months ago, which came directly after it received its long-awaitedBritish banking license. Since then, Revolut has entered multiple markets,named a chairof its Western Europe arm and finalized itsbanking license in Mexico. It’s also exploring U.S. growth, with Revolut U.S. CEO Sid Jajodia saying in October thatnabbing a stateside charteris part of the firm’s growth “mission.” “The level of investor interest and our new valuation reflect the strength of our business model, which is delivering both rapid growth and strong profitability,” CFO Victor Stinga said in a prepared statement on the recent share sale. “We welcome onboard a series of world-class investors and look forward to working with them for the next stage in Revolut’s evolution.” The transaction was led by Coatue, Greenoaks, Dragoneer and Fidelity Management & Research Company. Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Andreessen Horowitz, Franklin Templeton and T. Rowe Price Associates also participated. In ablog postMonday, Coatue wrote that it sees Revolut “charting a new path.” “They are building the world’s first global financial super-app, which is now operating in 39 countries and serves over 65 million users,” wrote Brendan O’Boyle, Rohan Bharvani and Lucas Swisher, investors at Coatue, which also led Revolut’s 2024 funding round. “What began as a travel card designed to avoid high [foreign exchange] fees has evolved into a multi-product financial platform that is redefining what modern banking looks like for consumers and businesses.” Revolut’s 2024 revenue grew 72% to $4 billion year over year, with profit before tax more than doubling to $1.4 billion. Its Revolut Business arm hit $1 billion in annualized revenue in 2025, the company said. The new valuation “reflects the remarkable progress we have made in the last twelve months towards our vision of building the first truly global bank, serving 100 million customers across 100 countries,” CEO Nik Storonsky said in a prepared statement.

"Comerica, Fifth Third sued by activist investor","Just days after threatening legal action against Comerica, HoldCo Asset Management has sued the regional bank and its proposed buyer, Fifth Third. The activist investor accused Comerica CEO Curt Farmer of being “focused solely on advancing his own interests” based on the “rushed” way the Dallas-based bank’s proposed$10.9 billion acquisition by Fifth Thirdcame together. Theclass-action complaint, filed Friday in the Delaware Court of Chancery by HoldCo Opportunities Fund, alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by Comerica and its board members related to the transaction and its “draconian” provisions. It also accuses the bank of leaving out material information from disclosures related to the deal. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCo also accused Fifth Third of “aiding-and-abetting” the board in breaching its fiduciary duty. HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July, accusing the lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” In October, Fifth Third announced it would acquire Comerica. HoldCoissued a presentationlast week that picked apart the proposed deal, threatening to take Comerica to court if it didn’t release more information on how the agreement came together. Comerica rebuffed at leastone earlier suitor, Financial Institution A, according to a disclosure. That was Regions Bank, American Banker reported. The deal between Comerica and Fifth Third was “negotiated over an extraordinarily compressed timeline,” HoldCo’s Friday complaint contends. It was driven by Farmer’s “fear of an activist contest” led by HoldCo, “and his fear that no other bidder would keep him on,” the firm alleged. “Fearing for his job, Farmer raced to find a friendly white knight that could provide him with a lucrative post-closing role,” the complaint asserts. Farmer isset to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks. Part of the rush, HoldCo claims, was to avoid any proxy contest at Comerica’s annual meeting, to have been held by May 2026. The Fifth Third deal is projected to close in the first quarter of 2026. Although Comerica received an offer from Financial Institution A, the complaint alleges the Dallas bank decided to “nip those negotiations in the bud” and solely focus on Fifth Third. The deal came together hastily and in a way that ensures “no topping bid could disrupt Farmer’s entrenchment plan,” HoldCo attorneys alleged. The merger agreement carries a “gargantuan” termination fee of $500 million and “an absurdly narrow fiduciary-out” that doesn’t let the board scrap the merger for a higher bid, HoldCo said in the complaint. The “draconian” deal protections mean Comerica’s board couldn’t terminate the acquisition for a better proposal until October 2026, even if shareholders don’t vote in favor of the deal, the filing said. HoldCo also alleges the registration statement is “materially misleading and incomplete” and doesn’t provide shareholders with any details that would allow them to compare the deal’s terms with Financial Institution A’s proposed offers. “There is no evidence from the Registration Statement that Comerica ever made a counterproposal or tried to negotiate for a price above the lowest end of the exchange ratio range in Fifth Third’s initial proposal,” the complaint said. “Nor is there any evidence that Comerica made any attempt to re-engage Financial Institution A (to see if it would provide a better proposal) or solicit interest from other potential bidders.” The 17-day span – from the start of potential merger conversations between Farmer and Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence to when an agreement was signed – “is the shortest timeframe of any of the ten largest bank mergers, with the next shortest taking 43 days and the median taking 67 days,” HoldCo contended. “Such negotiations are more reminiscent of distressed bank sales during the 2008 global financial crisis,” the complaint said. In aresponse filed Monday, attorneys for Comerica argued HoldCo’s views are at odds with those of other bank shareholders, and blasted the activist for “asking this Court to deprive stockholders of a merger after agitating for just such a deal.” Fifth Third’s attorneys, in aseparate Monday filing, called HoldCo’s aiding and abetting assertion a “facially meritless claim.” “This case is only about HoldCo’s self-serving activism goals,” Fifth Third’s attorneys said. Comerica and Fifth Third attorneys accused HoldCo of “gamesmanship” and called its claims weak. Comerica’s lawyers also needled HoldCo for “revel[ing] in its notoriety” after pushing for the bank to sell itself and seeking credit for the outcome. Comerica’s attorneys also noted HoldCo was in communication with the bank’s counsel in the days leading up to filing Friday’s complaint. “At no time during those communications did HoldCo indicate it would be filing a suit to enjoin the deal on Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week,” Comerica’s attorneys said. The shareholder vote on the acquisition is tentatively scheduled for Jan. 6. A hearing was set to be held Tuesday related to a motion to expedite the case. Spokespeople for Comerica and Fifth Third declined to comment. Attorneys withBernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman, the law firm representing HoldCo, didn’t return requests for comment. HoldCo also didn’t respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-sued-activist-investor-holdco/806428/,,
Fulton Financial to buy NJ’s Blue Foundry in $243M deal,"Fulton Financial Corp.will acquire Blue Foundry Bancorpin an all-stock transaction valued at $243 million, the companies announced Monday. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, pushes Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based Fulton into northern New Jersey. The bank gained a presence in the southern part of the state last year with itsacquisition of Republic First. The Philadelphia-based bank had locations in New Jersey and New York before it failed. Acquiring $2.15 billion-asset Blue Foundry, headquartered in Rutherford, New Jersey, gives $32 billion-asset Fulton 21 additional branches in eight counties, including four of the state’s most populous. “The expansion in northern New Jersey aligns with our strategy of growing in our local markets and positions us well to drive organic growth across our commercial, consumer, wealth advisory and mortgage businesses,” Fulton CEO Curtis Myers said in a prepared statement. “The combination of our companies creates an opportunity to leverage Fulton’s robust banking services and provide greater convenience and innovative solutions to an expanded customer base, with a continued focus on supporting our local communities,” he said. Under the terms of the agreement, Blue Foundry investors will receive 0.65 shares of Fulton common stock for each share they own. The transaction’s estimated $243 million value stems from Fulton’s $17.96 share price from Friday. “Joining forces with Fulton is an exciting step forward for our employees, customers and communities,” Blue Foundry CEO James Nesci said in a prepared statement. “This partnership allows us to preserve the local relationships and personalized service our customers value, while gaining access to greater resources and providing more solutions and convenience to customers.” In recent years, Blue Foundry has been a publicly traded bank, during which time it has reported more than $20 million in losses,American Bankerreported. Activist investor Larry Seidman, who had pushed for its sale via proxy campaign last year, told American Banker there was “no question whatsoever” that Fulton would be able to produce better results than Blue Foundry has with its assets. “It's a good bank with good management,” Seidman said of Fulton. “Blue Foundry was horrible. They couldn't make any money.” The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to tangible book value per share. It’s expected to be accretive to first full-year earnings by over 5%, and neutral to regulatory capital ratios at close. As part of the deal, Fulton will make a $1.5 million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation, which provides impact grants to nonprofit community organizations in New Jersey.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fulton-financial-to-buy-nj-blue-foundry-243m-deal/806443/,,
MoneyLion to pay $1.75M to settle CFPB lawsuit,"MoneyLion agreed Friday topay $1.75 millionto settle a long-running lawsuit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, alleging the fintech charged more than the maximum 36% interest rate allowed by the Military Lending Act on loans to service members. The settlement narrows – to 12 – the number of cases the CFPB has in active litigation, based on acount given last weekby a representative of the bureau’s workers union. The CFPB has dismissed 22 enforcement actions this year. The case also bolsters the CFPB’s commitment –from April, and subsequently reinforced in a “humility pledge” Friday – to focus on providing redress to service members, veterans and their families. As part of the settlement, MoneyLion is barred from extending consumer credit at rates higher than 36% to borrowers for whom the MLA cap applies. That includes credit insurance premiums or fees, any fee for a debt cancellation contract or debt suspension agreement, or any fee for a credit-related ancillary product sold as part of a credit transaction. It also includes finance charges, application fees or membership fees. That was a focal point of the CFPB’sSeptember 2022 lawsuitagainst the company. MoneyLion required customers to join a membership program – which carried a monthly fee between $19.99 and $29 – to access the fintech’s low annual percentage rate installment loan product, the bureau said when the suit was first filed. But the company failed to allow borrowers to cancel their memberships until their loans were paid, and in some cases, wouldn’t cancel memberships if the borrower had unpaid membership fees, the CFPB added. Friday’s settlement bars MoneyLion from preventing borrowers from canceling their membership. It also does not permit the fintech to engage in collections activities for past unpaid membership fees, collecting membership fees for periods when memberships were suspended. MoneyLion also can’t prevent borrowers from paying off loans in full by using funds in their credit reserve account, according to the settlement. Nor can the company ding borrowers’ credit scores over unpaid membership fees. Also as part of the settlement, MoneyLion must submit an accurate written compliance report, sworn under penalty of perjury, to the CFPB, detailing the number of borrowers who received redress and the amount paid to each. The settlement covers borrowers who had outstanding MoneyLion loans between December 2017 and October 2024. MoneyLion, in September 2022, disputed the CFPB’s allegations, accusing the regulator of taking a “sensationalist route of prioritizing headlines instead of engaging in constructive dialogue.” “MoneyLion has the highest regard for its military and veteran customers and [is] committed to working with this important community to help them achieve better financial health,” the company said at the time. “MoneyLion is honored to serve this important segment of its customer base and is grateful for the sacrifice these men and women have made for our country.” The membership offering represents a small subset of MoneyLion’s business, the company said at the time. Since then, the fintech has come under new management: MoneyLionwas acquired this yearby Gen Digital forabout $1 billion. The CFPB is also not the only entity with a consumer-protection case against MoneyLion.New York’s attorney generalsued MoneyLion and fellow earned wage access provider DailyPay in April, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to tens of thousands of workers with fees that “amount to outrageous annual interest rates in the triple digits.” Thecity of Baltimorelast month sued MoneyLion, alleging the company misled and manipulated consumers into taking out small-dollar, short-term loans that come with high fees. MoneyLion in 2023 persuaded the judge in the CFPB case topause proceedingsahead of aSupreme Court rulingthat affirmed the bureau’s funding structure is constitutional.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-moneylion-settlement-mla-interest-rate-36-cap-military-membership-fees/806439/,,
U.S. Bank hires up for greater Southeast growth,"After adding bankers to serve businesses in Dallas and Houston, U.S. Bank is now focused on further expansion across the Southeast, a business banking executive said. Within the next six months, U.S. Bank plans to hire at least a dozen bankers in a couple of Southeast states where it doesn’t have branches, said Dee O’Dell, head of business banking sales at the Minneapolis-based lender. He didn’t elaborate, butthat group includesAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. The super-regional bank has recently added teams of bankers in markets where it’s seeing greater growth opportunity, including a second team in Charlotte, North Carolina; a second in Las Vegas; and a fourth in Chicago, O’Dell said during a recent interview. In his unit, about 250 people have been hired into new roles this year. In Houston, where the $695 billion-asset bank announced last week it added a business banking team, four people have been hired and the lender plans to bring on two more, he said. In U.S. Bank’s business banking segment, which serves companies generating between $2.5 million to $50 million in annual revenue, about 1,200 employees across the country serve about 75,000 clients, O’Dell said. The consumer and business banking segmentmakes up about 32%of the lender’s overall revenue, which was $21.3 billion year to date,as of Sept. 30. U.S. Bank provides those commercial clients with different types of credit for their capital needs, including conventional financing, owner-occupied real estate loans and Small Business Administration loans. Clients in that size range often “not only have their primary business, but they're looking for ways to diversify,” O’Dell said. “They not only want to own the building they're in, they may want to own some other buildings as well, and so we've got the ability to provide capital for them, not only for their core business, but for investment real estate.” Bankers also seek to connect clients with other U.S. Bank services, such as credit cards, merchant processing, treasury management, foreign exchange and wealth management. Amid a highly competitive landscape, the lender has sharpened efforts to offer anddeliver services to clientsin a comprehensive way, O’Dell said. “Our approach has been to integrate all that together so that there is value that comes from having all of that in one place,” he said. To zero in on where businesses could gain the most benefit, the bank developed – along with a fintech O’Dell wouldn’t name – a proprietary diagnostic tool for companies. The questionnaire assesses business needs and money movement, diagnoses the level of efficiency in those functions and has a team review results with business clients. “The idea is that instead of trying to sell any one of those products, we're approaching it in a much more consultative and holistic way,” O’Dell said. “It helps our clients see how they can be even more efficient, save time in their day, eliminate risk of fraud, other things like that.” That diagnostic effort has bolstered the bank’s success rate in serving new clients since it was introduced nearly two years ago, O’Dell said. “Sometimes our bankers will meet with a company that we don't bank with today. And if your question is, ‘Do you need any banking services?’ The answer might be, ‘No, no, everything's fine. It's all good,’” O’Dell said. “If we can get them to engage with us and have this conversation and fill out this basic template questionnaire, we can go back and provide insights. And often, it opens up a conversation where companies don't even realize the things that they are doing or not doing that could lead to so much greater efficiency.” Another newer internal tool aggregates data to give bankers a view of companies or prospects within the markets they serve, allowing them to sort by sales size, industry type or ownership of property, so they can better target clients based on potential needs, O’Dell said. SBA loans may be a prime option for some of those businesses and that’s an area of lending U.S. Bank seeks to grow further, since it can serve as a company’s entry point into the bank. U.S. Bank has doubled its SBA lending in the past two years, O’Dell said. In fiscal 2025, the bank totaled $871.2 million in SBA 7(a) loans, up 23% from the previous fiscal year,it said last month. “We've been able to use that program to help a number of companies, individuals get capital they wouldn't otherwise be able to get, and because of the way that we approach that, and our client selection in that, the loss ratio that we've had in that space has been very attractive to our shareholders,” O’Dell said. SBA lending can be ideal in some succession situations, O’Dell noted. The segment of businesses O’Dell oversees has a significant number of owners nearing the end of their careers, so the bank also aims to jump on the chance to be involved in those moments. In cases where a business owner doesn’t have a child who wants to take over, they may look to sell to a similar company or private equity firm. Or if there’s someone in the company who’s interested in acquiring it but doesn’t have the capital, the bank can use an SBA loan to help with that pursuit. “We see great opportunities to help the next generation of business owners acquire business and a current generation who are at the end of their careers, exit, monetize what they've invested in, and have this sense that their legacy will continue,” O’Dell said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/us-bank-adding-business-bankers-southeast-odell/806212/,,
VALT Bank applies for de novo charter,"A group of former U.S. Bank executives is seeking federal approval to establish VALT Bank, applications submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Nov. 13 show. The proposed bank, headquartered in Eagle, Idaho, will be fully digital and will focus on serving “digitally demanding small to midsized businesses” in the U.S., according to its application. VALT plans to offer credit and deposit products as well as treasury and cash management services, and plans to provide clients with SMB-focused automation solutions. The bank will be led by proposed director, CEO and President Matt Gediman, whose nearly two-decade U.S. Bank career culminated in three years as a managing director in the bank’s private wealth management business. “When we refer to ‘digitally demanding SMBs,’ we mean revenue-generating small and midsized businesses that use technology across their daily operations and expect the same level of technological fluency from their financial service providers,” Gediman told Banking Dive via email Monday. These are traditional businesses, he added – not tech firms or crypto companies. VALT does not plan to interact with digital assets. “Our customers are established SMBs that simply expect modern, reliable, integrated digital banking,” he said. “[O]ur model is designed to support them by making banking uncomplicated, accessible, and integrated with digital tools to run their businesses more efficiently,” he said. Former U.S. Bank Vice Chairman John Elmore is VALT’s proposed executive chair and Ross Carey, former U.S. Bank EVP of business banking and SBA division, is its proposed vice chair. Kim Hoyt, attorney at Salem, Oregon-based law firm Garrett Hemann Robertson, and Dana Johnson, president and chief investment officer at single-family office MidAmerica Capital Partners, are VALT’s additional proposed directors. The OCC declined to comment on the application, and the FDIC did not respond immediately to a request for comment. But the heads of both agencies have recently spoken in favor of increased de novo chartering. Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gouldtold Banking Dive last monththat one of his major goals while at the helm of the OCC is “invigorating de novo chartering in America.” Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hillnoted earlier this year that new bank formationhas “fallen off a cliff” in recent years. At the American Bankers Association’s Washington Summit in April, he noted that 412 new banks were formed in 1984 alone, and that the lowest number of new banks established in any year between 1995 and 2007 was 93. By comparison, just 86 new banks have been formed since 2010, Hill said, and more than half of them came between 2019 and 2022 when Trump appointee Jelena McWilliams ran the FDIC. The OCC and the FDIC have received a number of bank applications since President Donald Trump took office again in January. Applicants includingCoinbaseandStripe-owned Bridgeseek national trust charters, which do not allow for lending or taking insured deposits. One bank – Erebor Bank, which applied for a de novo charter in June – has received conditional approval under Gould’s leadership. Its conditional approval wasgranted in October. TheOCC leasing manualindicates that the agency should make decisions on a charter application within 120 days of receiving it, lining VALT up for an answer by mid-March. Gediman, for VALT’s part, said the team’s intention is to “build a safe, well-governed institution that meets the needs of modern business owners through a unique digital-first experience.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/valt-bank-applies-for-de-novo-charter/806295/,,
CFPB can’t ignore judge’s order: workers union,"Lawyers for a workers unionurged a federal courtSunday to clarify apreliminary injunctionto ensure that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau leaders don’t shutter the agency by refusing funding. “The defendants have filed a ‘notice’ announcing that they intend to allow the Bureau to run out of funding, and when it does, they will stop complying with the Court’s injunction,” attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union wrote Sunday. “Parties may not simply declare that an injunction no longer applies.” The CFPB this monthalertedthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it “anticipates exhausting its currently available funds in early 2026.” At issue is the definition of “combined earnings.” The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel sent a memo to CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought on Nov. 7, asserting that it interprets earnings – from which the Federal Reserve derives the CFPB’s operating budget – as profit rather than revenue. By that math, the Fed has operated at a loss since 2022. NTEU attorneys asserted Sunday that the Fed earns “billions of dollars a year – from interest on loans and securities, and fees assessed” on banks. But because the Fed has raised interest rates since 2022, its combined interest expenses have exceeded combined earnings. The plaintiffs cite congressional testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told lawmakers the central bank examined that balance “very carefully” and concluded the law is “very clear” that the Fed must fund the CFPB even when its expenses exceed its earnings. Further, NTEU attorneys said, the OLC memo “admits, nobody – not any court, not the Fed, and not the CFPB – has ever interpreted” combined earnings as it suggested this month. “Both the Fed and the CFPB (until Vought needed a mechanism to circumvent this Court’s injunction) have consistently understood ‘combined earnings’ to mean, simply, everything the Fed earns,” NTEU attorneys wrote. The OLC’s interpretation relies on “technical definitions from corporate accounting,” NTEU attorneys wrote. “But the Fed is not a private corporation. It sets monetary policy for the United States. … The only reason to adopt its reading of ‘combined earnings’ is to shut down the CFPB.” Vought, in an appearance last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” indeed said of the CFPB: “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within thenext two, three months.” The bureau last week indicated it istransferring all of its active litigationto the DOJ. By the OLC’s logic, NTEU attorneys wrote, Congress would have passed a Dodd-Frank Act “that forces the Federal Reserve Board to choose between increasing interest rates to combat inflation and funding the CFPB.” “Fortunately, that is not the law that Congress wrote,” the attorneys asserted, blasting the CFPB for not choosing another path. “Rather than asking this Court to modify its injunction (which would require them to demonstrate that it should), the defendants have chosen to just ‘inform’ the Court that they ‘do not understand’ the injunction to bind them once the CFPB runs out of money – even if that’s because they decided not to ask the Fed for funding,” NTEU attorneys wrote. Outside of the courtroom, the CFPB on Friday issued what it termed a “humility pledge” meant to be read aloud by bank examiners to banks before exams. The statement drills down on the bureau’snarrowing of focustoward consumer threats that harm service members, veterans and their families and reiterates that the bureau will “avoid, where possible, duplication of supervision, where States or other regulators are already doing that job.” The bureau pledges shorter examination times – reduced from eight weeks to a period “commensurate with the defined scope of exams.” “No longer will the Bureau ask for expansive data sets or other information which may seem unrelated to the exam or include information inconsistent with Bureau priorities,” the pledge reads. “Any follow-up requests by examiners will first be discussed with an entity and will be tailored to the scope of the exam and the information already received from the entity.” The CFPB states its goal as “[to] work collaboratively with the entities to review entities’ processes for compliance and/or remedy existing problems,” emphasizing self-reporting and encouraging banks to resolve issues with the CFPB’s supervision unit, rather than enforcement. That may lend credence to a narrative, from an all-hands meeting of enforcement staff, in which the bureau’s acting enforcement chief said all 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation at the end of the year. Curiously, perhaps, the pledge encourages banks, if they find their exam experience to be “inconsistent with these principles,” to reach out via email to a designated CFPB supervisory official or the bureau’s chief legal officer. In apost Monday on the NTEU’s website, union member Alexis Goldstein asked, “Why is Russell Vought showing the world his weird, creepy pledge of allegiance to big corporations?” Another union member, Doug Wilson, notes a passage in the pledge in which the bureau asserts that examiners will be “encouraged and incentivized to complete the work promptly and under budget.” “This memo doesn't add up,” Wilson wrote. “Vought’s stopped all supervision exams in 2025, refuses to fund CFPB and says he’s shutting us down by 2026. So how will we supervise banks in 2026 if CFPB is closed? How can bank exams be ‘under budget’ if there is no budget?” In an emailed press release to accompany the humility pledge, the CFPB characterized the bureau’s Biden-era supervision efforts as “thuggery,” calling out ex-supervision chief LoreleiSalas as “a former [Democratic donor George] Soros activist who wasput on leave in February 2025.” Further, bureau leadership labeled the pre-Trump supervision unit as “a weaponized arm of the CFPB.” In aLinkedIn post, Allison Preiss, who until February served as senior adviser to the CFPB director, said the humility pledge “might be better characterized as a humiliation pledge.” “The notion that federal employees should genuflect, trembling, before a Wells Fargo or Bank of America, is some of the most ridiculous nonsense I've read all week,” she wrote. In anotherLinkedIn post, Tyler Creighton, counsel at the CFPB, took issue with the idea that the bureau is calling out examiners’ past conduct. “Supervision's workers have always conducted examinations professionally, efficiently, conscientiously, and with a focus on remedying consumer harm,” he wrote. “We will continue to do so, just as soon as Donald Trump and Russell Vought end the nearly 10-month suspension of examinations and let us get back to work for the American people.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-humility-pledge-supervision-enforcement-bank-examiners-fed-funding-refuse-vought-court/806314/,,
Stripe faces bank charter pushback,"A national trust banking charter would let the digital payments giant Stripe offer banking services while sidestepping certain regulations, an advocacy organization opposingthe payment provider's charter applicationargued in a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency this month. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition alsosaid in the letterthat the charter would give Stripe legitimacy that it does not deserve, pointing to the fintech’s history of legal trouble. Stripe, whichacquired a stablecoin infrastructure companycalled Bridge this year, proposes to name the bank Bridge National Trust. “The OCC must reject Stripe’s application for a national trust bank charter due to serious concerns regarding Stripe’s disregard for enforcement, governance, compliance, and consumer protection laws,” according to the Nov. 13 letter, which is addressed to Sebastian Astrada, the agency’s director for licensing of novel banks. The NCRC is a coalition of hundreds of U.S. community-based organizations which run the gamut from faith-based nonprofits to social justice advocates. The organization posted the letter on its website last week. Bridgeapplied for the charter in October. The charter would give Bridge and its parent company the right to provide custody, stablecoin issuance, and management of stablecoin reserves within a federal framework, rather than through state-to-state money transmitter licenses. Spokespeople for Stripe did not respond to messages seeking comment about the NCRC’s letter. If the charter is approved, Bridge would form the Bridge National Trust Bank, to be headquartered in New York City, according tothe Oct. 14 application. CEO Patrick Collison co-founded Stripe along with his brother John Collison, who is president of the business. “We’ve long believed stablecoins will be a core, regulated building block,” Bridge co-founder Zach Abrams wroteon the social media platform Xlast month. “This regulatory infrastructure will enable us to tokenize trillions of dollars and make this future possible.” The crypto firmsCircle,Paxos,RippleandCoinbasehave also applied for charters through the OCC, although none of those applications has been approved yet. With the trust, Stripe could also facilitate payments without supervision from the Federal Reserve, the NCRC said in its letter. “Granting these firms limited purpose trust charters would blur the statutory boundaries of what constitutes a bank, undermine the credibility of the national charter, and heighten systemic risk by allowing them to operate under a lighter regulatory regime,” the group wrote. The coalition also outlines some of the lawsuits and legal action taken against Stripe. In 2020, for example, the Massachusetts attorney general found Stripe had facilitated payments for a fraudulent cryptocurrency operation due to subpar risk monitoring and fraud prevention systems. The companyagreed to pay $120,000and improve its fraud control and employee training. The letter also lists several lawsuits against the company alleging, among other things, that Stripe failed to ensure customer privacy and protect customer data.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/stripe-faces-bank-charter-pushback/806315/,,
How the open banking rule skidded,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said this month it cannot draw funding to continue operations when its current funds lapse, presenting the agency a number of challenges in formulating an open banking rule quickly. The CFPBtold a federal courtNov. 11 that the Justice Department had concluded that the bureau cannot “lawfully draw funds” from the Federal Reserve System – which Congress designated as its funding source – and that the agency has funds to operate until year’s end. The bureau’s notice did not specify what would happen then, although the CFPB’s acting director, Russ Vought, has assailed the agency in the past and spoke publicly in October about itsclosure within months. The bureau has been working on a new open banking rule since July, when it told a federal court it would “substantially”revise the ruleand was granted a litigation stay of a lawsuitfiled last yearby banking trade groups. The CFPB did not respond to an email Monday seeking comment on the rule. Last week, the bureau notified employees that it wouldtransfer its litigation workto the DOJ and planned additional furloughs at year’s end. In its motion for a stay, the bureau told U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves it planned “an accelerated rulemaking process” to address what it considered to be deficiencies with the prior rule, enacted under the Biden administration. But any proposed rule with significant changes – such as allowing financial institutions to charge fees for access to customers’ data – would also require the bureau to assess the impacts to small businesses under the federal Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, attorneys noted. At that point, a public comment period on the proposed rule – typically 30 to 90 days – would begin. The CFPB would then consider those comments and issue a final rule. However, the bureau is considering skipping some parts of the rulemaking process to issue a rule by year’s end, potentially including a public comment period on its proposed rule,Bloomberg Law reportedThursday, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. “Given the polarized view of these rules by the banking and FinTech sectors, if either constituency objects to the substance of the CFPB’s revisions, additional litigation could ensue,” an attorney with law firm McGlinchey Stafford, Adam Maarec, wrote in a Septemberalertabout the process. “An ‘accelerated rulemaking’ still takes a long time,” added Maarec, who advises fintechs and banks. The prior rule took CFPB staff four years from the rulemaking notice to a final rule, he noted, adding “the scope of issues here seems significantly narrower.” Banking groups that sued the bureau last year leaned heavily on the Administrative Procedure Act for their complaint, arguing that the agency had overstepped its authority to impose “a complicated, costly, and fundamentally insecure mandatory data-sharing framework” that did not allow banks to recover their costs. Last month, Reeves issued apreliminary injunctionpreventing the bureau from enforcing its rule, pending the revised rule the CFPB is formulating. A spokesperson for the Bank Policy Institute said Monday the organization understands that the bureau’s rulemaking process is moving forward but declined to comment further, directing other queries to the agency. The Financial Data and Technology Association, which counts data aggregators Plaid and Yodlee as members, said it continues to oppose any effort allowing banks to impose fees for customer data. Both Plaid and Yodlee have announced agreements with the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase, in the past two months that include new fees for data access. The Dodd-Frank Act does not permit fees, which are “a competitive toll on consumers simply for exercising their right to access and share their own financial information,” FDATA Executive Director Steve Boms said Monday in an emailed statement. “If banks are given the green light to impose those fees in a new rule, it would fundamentally shift control of financial data away from consumers and toward already powerful incumbents.” A spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association declined to comment Friday on the CFPB’s future or rule process, as did the American Fintech Council on Monday. Vought, who also leads the Office of Management and Budget, has been trying todramatically downsizethe CFPB’s workforce and mission since he was appointed acting director in February. “We don’t have anyone working there except our Republican appointees and a few career [employees] that are doing statutory responsibilities while weclose down the agency,” Vought said last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months.” Conservative lawmakers and interest groups have targeted the bureau since Congress formed it 15 years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. “The CFPB is a highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency. It is unconstitutional,” the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote in its “Project 2025Mandate for Leadership” document, in a chapter written by Robert Bowes, ahousing department officialin the first Trump administration and a former Chase Manhattan banking executive. “The next conservative President should order the immediate dissolution of the agency — pull down its prior rules, regulations and guidance, return its staff to their prior agencies and its building to the General Services Administration.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-open-banking-rule-skidded-fintechs-banks-vought-court/806436/,,
Ex-Truist employee sentenced in ‘complex’ check-cashing scheme,"A former Truist branch employee is one of eight Georgia residents sentenced in a counterfeit check-cashing scheme that involved stolen check information, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgiasaid Wednesday. The “complex” check-cashing and kickback scheme ran from at least November 2021 to December 2022, prosecutors said. At the time, Mariarlene Brown, aka “Mati Mom,” 44, of Valdosta, worked at a Truist branch in that city. In conspiring with Brown and others to commit bank fraud, William Allen Roberts, 27, of Valdosta, unlawfully obtained check information from Vincent Galliard, 41, of Sumter, South Carolina. Galliard was a former U.S. Postal Service employee in South Carolina who sold checks he stole from the mail, prosecutors said. Roberts used the check information provided by Galliard to produce fraudulent checks. Six others involved in the scheme recruited people to open Truist bank accounts and then got those people to provide their new Truist debit card and account information to those behind the scheme, “with the understanding that they would be paid for doing so,” prosecutors said. That group of co-conspirators included Frederick Pernell Green, 27; Thomas Christopher Mitchell, 31; Calvin Dewayne McKeithen, aka “Supa,” 26; Dewayne Rasheen Butler, aka “Guwapo,” 26; Tyler Khershad Jones, aka “LA Clippers,” 24; and Davontay Wiseman, aka “Vonn,” 28. Those six then passed the account information on to Roberts, who would write checks to those individuals in various amounts. Roberts, with Brown’s help, deposited checks into those accounts, and Brown made sure Roberts could withdraw cash from the accounts, according to prosecutors. Roberts paid Brown for her help in the scheme, as well as the co-conspirators and account holders, prosecutors said. Green, Roberts, Mitchell, McKeithen, Jones, Butler and Wiseman kept most of each check that was deposited, prosecutors said. Text messages the group members exchanged described the conspiracy, and investigators also discovered photos of debit cards, account numbers, fraudulent checks, cash obtained from the check deposits “and a custom-made diamond ring in the shape of the Truist logo worn by Green,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Brown was sentenced to 33 months in prison, five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $390,475.84 in restitution to Truist on Oct. 9, after she pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Seven others – all except Galliard – also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, were sentenced to prison time and ordered to pay Truist restitution in the same amount. Galliard pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a South Carolina case and was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison, along with five years of supervised release, prosecutors said. Galliard was ordered to pay $149,692.14 in restitution divided among The Citizens Bank, First Citizens Bank, South Atlantic Bank, TD Bank, The Conway National Bank and Bank of America, according toa court filing. “Individuals who participate in check-cashing and kickback schemes will face imprisonment and other penalties,” U.S. Attorney Will Keyes said in the press release. “Investigators from the Secret Service and the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office worked to unravel this criminal network, ultimately preventing further theft and helping us ensure accountability for the defendants.” Bank regulators seek to bolster their efforts to address check fraud, which has grown “substantially” in the past several years, Michelle Bowman, the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision,said in June. Although check use has dropped, check fraud hasn’t diminished in tandem. “Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of real or attempted check fraud transactions grew nearly fourfold, even as the number of checks paid fell by more than 18 percent from 2018 to 2021,”the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantareported this year.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ex-truist-employee-sentenced-check-cashing-scheme/806169/,,
Citi CFO Mark Mason to step down in March,"Citi CFO Mark Mason, arguably the highest-profile Black executive at a U.S.-based global systemically important financial institution, will step down from his role in early March, the bankannounced Thursday. At that point, Gonzalo Luchetti, now the bank’s head of U.S. personal banking, will become CFO. Mason, meanwhile, will transition to executive vice chair and senior executive adviser to Citi CEO Jane Fraser, but he intends to pursue leadership opportunities outside the bank by the end of 2026, according to the announcement. In his adviser role, Mason will help Citi prepare for its investor day May 7 and give guidance on the bank’s strategic initiatives. Mason has been a key figure in Citi’stwo-year reorganization, in which the bank set out to simplify its structure,trim its headcount by 20,000employees by 2026, and embrace tech modernization meant to free it fromtwo 2020 consent orders. Citi launched further reorganization Thursday, saying it would integrate its retail bank into its wealth business. The move arguably hands more responsibility to wealth chief Andy Sieg. The bank’s U.S. Everyday Banking, Citi Priority, Citigold and Citigold Private Client labels will be consolidated into a single group led by Kate Luft. Luft, who has served as head of U.S. retail bankingsince April, will add “and Citigold” to her title and report to Sieg. With the move, “U.S. Personal Banking” will no longer be one of Citi’s five core businesses, the company said. But it will be replaced by “U.S. Consumer Cards,” which will combine the bank’s branded cards and retail services businesses under Pam Habner. Habner, who has served as Citi’s head of branded cards and lendingsince 2020, will join the bank’s executive management team and report directly to Fraser. “This evolution of our leadership team and structure is well timed as it puts in place our next generation of leaders ahead of our upcoming Investor Day, when we will lay out our plans to further grow our returns,” Fraser said Thursday in a statement. “We are ending the year with momentum and confidence.” Mason’s upcoming transition comes less than a month after Citi threw added support behind Fraser,naming her chairand giving her a $25 million equity award meant to keep her in place for years to come. Fraser on Thursday called Mason “an invaluable partner” who “models integrity, drive and commitment no matter the circumstances, and has always put the firm first.” “Mark has proven himself to be a leader for all seasons, having helped Citi navigate some of our most challenging times and being a driving force behind the results we are now seeing in our performance and our Transformation,” Fraser said, citing the capitalized term the bank gives its tech modernization. Mason joined Citi in 2001 and has been CFO since 2019 – but between those benchmarks has served as CEO of Citi’s private bank, CEO of Citi Holdings, and CFO of the bank’s Institutional Clients Group, according to hisLinkedIn profile. “Serving as CFO for the last seven years and contributing to a leadership team that is redefining expectations for Citi stands as one of the most demanding and fulfilling chapters of my career,” Mason said in a statement Thursday. “I know that Gonzalo will work tirelessly with the strong team we’ve built across Finance to further Citi’s momentum, and I am fully committed to his smooth transition into the new role.” Scott Siefers, a managing director and senior research analyst for Piper Sandler, called Mason’s departure “an unfortunate loss” for Citi. “Thankfully, he will be succeeded by an insider with deep experience,” Siefers wrote in a note seen by Banking Dive. Luchetti joined Citi in 2006 and has served, among other roles, as consumer banking chief for Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and as global head of wealth management and insurance, according to hisLinkedIn profile. He became head of U.S. personal banking in 2021 and on Thursday earned plaudits from Fraser for expanding his segment’s return on tangible common equity to 14.5% for 2025’s third quarter. “I knew exactly what we needed in our next CFO to build on Mark’s successful tenure,” Fraser said. “In addition to the table-stakes requirement of superb financial acumen, it must be someone who is strategically minded, data-driven, analytical, and an excellent operator. … Gonzalo is that person.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-mark-mason-cfo-step-down-march-gonzalo-luchetti-fraser-sieg-luft-habner/806137/,,
Wells Fargo taps Saul Van Beurden to scale AI,"Saul Van Beurden, chief executive of Wells Fargo consumer and small business banking,has been tappedto scale artificial intelligence at the bank, the lender said Thursday. Additionally, the bank’s CEO for consumer lending, Kleber Santos, will take on added responsibilities as co-CEO of consumer lending and banking as Wells formally combines the businesses, allowing Van Beurden to focus more on AI. “Generative and agentic AI will reshape competitive dynamics across every industry, and we are embracing these tools as we have embraced robotic process automation and machine learning for years,” Wells CEO Charlie Scharf said in a prepared statement. In August, Wells gave branch bankers, investment bankers, customer relations and corporate teamsaccess to AI agents and toolsfrom Google Cloud. The tools help employees sort through massive loads of documentation and provide real-time market insights, among other things. Wells is among banks in a near-ubiquitous industry pushtoward AI-fueled efficiencies. Wells has trained some 90,000 employees on AI this year, deployed AI tools to many others and is now broadening its uses, Scharf said. “Our employees and customers have powerful models in their hands. They expect the same at work,” Van Beurden toldForbesthis month on AI. “GenAI helps remove simple repetitive tasks, builds workflows and frees people to do higher-value work. We are scratching the surface.” The key is to deploy AI in ways that “enhance human performance rather than replace it,” he told Forbes. In his enhanced role, Van Beurden will help leaders in Wells’ businesses oversee transformation in their own segments, Scharf said in a prepared statement. “Success will be driven by business heads embracing these new technologies and rethinking their own operating models using generative and agentic AI solutions,” Scharf said. The advances in AI, he added, “have given us a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform how we work and we are excited by what we can deliver for our employees, customers and communities.” Van Beurden joined Wells in2019 from JPMorgan Chase, where he was chief information officer of consumer and community banking. The San Francisco-based bankelevated him in 2023from head of technology to CEO of consumer and small-business banking. A Wells spokesperson had no comment on the new appointments, or on AI adoption as a whole.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/wells-fargo-saul-van-beurden-ai-kleber-santos-expanded-responsibilities/806195/,,
CFPB is transferring its cases to DOJ,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is transferring all of its active litigation to the Justice Department, according to separate statements Thursday from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, and the workers union representing the agency. Further, Mike Salemi, the CFPB’s acting enforcement chief, said at an all-hands meeting Thursday that, as he understood it, all bureau employees would be furloughed at the end of the year,Government Executivereported, citing people familiar with the matter. Salemi hedged, saying he was not privy to all of the plans, but that the information came from an associate general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget who also serves as a senior legal adviser at the CFPB. The timeline, if true, would dovetail with a projection CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought made in a podcast appearance last month, when he said the only employees left at the bureau were “our Republican appointees and a few career [staff] that are doing statutory responsibilities while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the nexttwo, three months,” Vought said. Further, DOJ attorneys filed paperwork last week with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, indicating the CFPB “anticipates exhaustingits currently available funds in early 2026.” The filing was meant to flag a “potential lapse in appropriations” to pay the bureau’s operating expenses. The court this year granted apreliminary injunctionpreventing the CFPB from firing the vast majority of its staff. Included in the filing was a memo the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel sent Vought, asserting that the bureau may not legally request funds at this time from the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. Salemi on Thursday said the 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation, according to Government Executive. A few top officials may have the opportunity to work for DOJ,American Bankerreported, citing people who were part of the all-hands call. Salemi noted that the DOJ stood up an enforcement and affirmative litigation unit within its Civil Division in September. Salemi told CFPB staff he assumed the agency’s work would be routed there beginning in 2026, according to Government Executive. Cat Farman, president of the National Treasury Employees Union 335, which represents CFPB employees, said Vought has “no legal authority” to transfer the bureau’s cases to the DOJ. “This is Russ Vought’s latest illegal power grab in his ongoing plan to shut down the CFPB,” Farman said in a statement on theNTEU’s website. However, the Dodd-Frank Act indicates the DOJ has the authority to handle cases where no agency is designated to do so by law,Bloomberg Lawreported. Before the CFPB was established in 2011, the DOJ took cases under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act because no other agency had the power. The CFPB is still litigating 13 cases, Farman said, though Vought this year has dismissed 22 enforcement actions brought by the bureau under previous administrations. “CFPB attorneys are afraid DOJ will dismiss [the remaining] cases,” Farman said. The DOJ declined to comment. The CFPB didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Warren, the senator credited as the architect of the bureau, appeared to hold tight to her suspicions. “Donald Trump and Russ Vought are racing to shut down the CFPB while their lawyers tell the courts the opposite,”Warren wrotein a statement Thursday. “Nobody is fooled about the Trump-Vought end game, and the courts must uphold the law.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-transfer-litigation-doj-enforcement-furloughs-salemi-vought/806193/,,
"TD illegally targeted, fired Chinese-heritage employees: lawsuit","Five former TD Bank employees of Chinese heritage say the bank illegally fired them in the wake of TD’s fentanyl-tied money laundering scandal,court documents show. Plaintiffs Andrew Wong, Ka Po Wong, Anne Louie, April Ng and Millie Su allege that TD “intentionally targeted and disproportionately impacted the bank’s Chinese and Chinese American employees” to placate investigators as they probed the lender’santi-money laundering control issues, and to “give the appearance of robust AML procedures.” The bank’s “robust enforcement” went “far beyond the normal scope” in investigating the employees’ personal transaction histories, particularly cash exchanges that moved through their bank accounts, the plaintiffs said. Chinese families traditionally borrow money from family and friends, rather than banks, and it’s common for family members to gift funds for large purchases, such as a house, plaintiffs said, citing a “financial culture [that] is prevalent in the Chinese diaspora, including the Chinese-American community.” The investigators did not take that into account, the plaintiffs asserted. In one instance, investigators pressed Ng on a $500 transaction in new bills meant as a gift during Chinese New Year, a custom. In another, investigators questioned Su about $15,000 in cash she received from family members. The funds, intended as a house down payment gift to a family associate, were deposited into Su’s account. She added $5,000 from her account, and wrote the associate a $20,000 check. “The targeted Chinese and Chinese American employees provided proof that transactions questioned by TD were legitimate, yet each still suffered the most severe adverse employment action possible. They were terminated,” plaintiffs allege. “More callously, the terminated Chinese and Chinese American were demarketed from TD Bank. TD closed their personal and business accounts, and, upon information and belief, barred them from banking with TD in the future.” Prior to the fentanyl-tied AML investigation, TD “leveraged the national origin of its Chinese and Chinese American employees to foster trust in the Chinese community and build their business,” plaintiffs said. During the investigation, however, TD’s Chinese and Chinese American employees “were then targeted by the bank because of their ethnicity and national origin. They were punished for crimes committed by other Chinese individuals — crimes they were not involved in by individuals they did not know.” “Their Chinese heritage, once used by TD Bank to garner trust in the Chinese community, now became a target for TD,” plaintiffs said. Due to TD’s investigations of its Chinese and Chinese American employees in the New York City’s Chinatown branches alone, at least 22 employees were terminated or subject to adverse employment actions, the lawsuit asserted. All but one of the terminated employees were of Chinese origin. At least one employee was terminated for a transaction with a Chinese American employee, according to court documents. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement at their respective jobs, back pay and emotional damages sustained as a result of TD’s conduct. A TD spokesperson told Banking Dive that the bank has no comment, given that the litigation is pending. Arthur Schwartz, an attorney for the plaintiffs, did not respond to a request for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/td-illegally-targeted-fired-chinese-heritage-employees-lawsuit/806066/,,
Truist taps Microsoft alum as AI chief,"During his 27 years at Microsoft,Belaud held a number of leadership roles within the tech giant’s U.S. financial unit related to AI, data and data insights, customer success, analytics, cloud, machine learning and predictive analysis. Seventeen of those years were spent at Microsoft France in Paris and a decade at Microsoft’s New York office, according to Belaud’sLinkedIn post this week. Most recently, he was general manager of cloud and AI platforms for Microsoft’s U.S. financial services vertical. Top banks have been eager to embed artificial intelligence within their workflows to bolster efficiency and growth, and they’rekeen to realize efficienciesas their spending to support AI efforts increases.

Capital One joins FedNow,"Capital One joined the Federal Reserve’s instant payments system FedNow this week, leaving Bank of America and Truist among the major U.S. financial institutions not participating in that real-time ecosystem. Capital One started its FedNow participation Tuesday, a spokesperson for the bank said by email. “Financial Institutions of all sizes are rapidly enabling instant payments for their accountholders,” U.S. Faster Payments Council CEO Reed Luhtanen said by email, when asked for comment on how the system is developing. “The ability to offer instant money movement is becoming table stakes in our 21st century economy, and financial institutions that don’t have a faster payments strategy need to develop one, and fast.” A spokesperson for Bank of America didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson confirmed late last month that the bank had not yet joined FedNow. FedNow has attracted all but two of theeight biggest U.S. retail banks, according to a list of participants on theFederal Reserve’s FedNow website. The service allows for the transfer of payments between banks in seconds or minutes, as opposed to some alternatives that take days. While about 1,550 U.S. financial institutions have joined the FedNow system since itlaunched in July 2023, there are thousands that have not, despite the central bank’s efforts to attract smaller banks as well. In all, there are about 9,000 U.S. financial institutions, including large banks, smaller regional and community banks, and credit unions. (Only U.S. financial institutions are allowed to connect to the FedNow system.) Nonetheless, the large banks are the most active in the payments sphere. The 50 biggest banks operating in the U.S. account for more than 90% of payment originations on the major clearing systems operated by The Clearing House andNacha, based on those organizations’ statistics. To smooth the way to joining the system, the Fed is trying to make it as easy as possible. Currently, the “record” time period for onboarding a bank — from signing a contract with the central bank to offering services — is seven days, FedNow Chief Executive Nick Stanescusaid in a video poston FedNow’s website Tuesday. He noted there are also 41 certified service providers that aid in bringing bank clients to the system. To boost transaction volume, FedNow has been gradually increasing the maximum amount that can be sent over the system.

Lloyds to buy UK fintech Curve,"London-based Lloyds Bank will buy theU.K. fintech Curve, the bankannounced Wednesday. Lloyds did not disclose the price point for the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2026. But the acquisition lends credence to aSky Newsreport from last week, indicating the bank would pay £120 million for the digital wallet provider. That’s less than half the £250 million in funding Curve is said to have raised since its founding in 2015. And it’s far below the valuation CEO Shachar Bialick had targeted for the company. “In ten years’ time we are going to be IPO-ed … and hopefully worth around $50 billion to $60 billion,” Bialick, a former Israeli special forces soldier, toldThe Times of Londonin 2019, using the acronym for initial public offering. In a circular to investors last week, Curve said it “share[s] the disappointment some of you may have in this outcome.” “We recognize that the value of this transaction falls short of the ambitions we all held for Curve,” the company said in the note, seen by Sky News. “Yet, the board strongly believes this transaction represents the best available path forward for Curve's creditors and shareholders as a whole."" However, IDC Ventures, an investor that holds a 12% stake in Curve, said in a statement Friday it is ""deeply concerned about the conduct of Curve's management and board during the current sale process."" IDC alleged a small group of directors and investors at Curve “facilitated corporate decision-making to entrench control and override shareholder rights,” adding that “issues regarding [Curve’s] governance and ownership are disputed.” The investor sought toremove Curve's chairin September, but the effort failed. IDC has consistently opposed a sale to Lloyds since rumors of a potential transaction became public in July. The investor wrote “repeatedly” to Curve and its board, opposing the sale, “without receiving any meaningful response or engagement,” it asserted in September. IDC also said it wrote to Lloyds, but the bank did not respond. “It is a matter of real surprise to shareholders that Lloyds Banking Group, a leading UK institution, would contemplate proceeding with a transaction that IDC believes is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders,” IDC wrote Friday, adding it “does not believe” a sale could be “implemented” without the investor’s support. Curve’s auditors earlier this year had warned of “material uncertainty” at the firm, according toCityAM. Financial figures published in March revealed the company had paused its plans to expand to the U.S. and, in 2023, cut about a third of its workforce, according totech.eu. Curve reported a pretax loss of £36 million in 2023, up from £69 million the year before. Bialick, when asked if Curve would be profitable in 2024, said the company’s “priority is sustainable expansion, and we anticipate reaching break-even in the near term.” Curve touts a digital wallet platform that brings all of a user’s cards and alternative payment sources into one place, while offering payment flexibility, real-time spend insights and no foreign exchange fees. In a statement onCurve’s blog Wednesday, Bialick said Curve’s “mission” has always been to “simplify and supercharge people’s finances.” “Joining forces with Lloyds Banking Group means we can now scale that vision faster, helping tens of millions more customers unlock smarter payments, and empower greater financial accessibility,” he said. Curve, on its own, counts 6 million customers. Lloyds, by comparison, reaches 28 million. The bank announced in January it planned toclose 136 branchesin the U.K. as customers rely more heavily on digital banking. Buying a digital wallet platform, presumably, would dovetail with that vision. “Building on the innovative changes we’ve made to our app recently, integrating Curve’s cutting-edge technology and digital wallet capabilities will deliver a next-generation digital banking experience for our customers as we help them to take control of their finances in a simple and convenient way,” Jas Singh, CEO of consumer relationships at Lloyds, said in a release Wednesday. Lloyds said Wednesday the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the bank, or to affect full-year guidance for 2025 or 2026.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/lloyds-bank-uk-acquire-fintech-curve-digital-wallet-120-million-idc-investor-concern/806065/,,
NY AG’s office scrutinizes SoLo Funds,"Fintech lender SoLo Funds is engaged with the New York attorney general’s office related to usury concerns, an executive said this week. Denzel Singletary, head of government affairs and strategic partnerships at the company, said SoLo Funds was served a subpoena this year by state AG Letitia James’ office. “We're in negotiations with them now, figuring out … what common ground looks like,” Singletary said, speaking Monday at the Banking Transformation Summit in Charlotte, North Carolina, on the topic of fintechs and regulators working together. James’ office declined to comment Tuesday. After SoLo Funds was subpoenaed, “my job initially was to make sure New York knew that we were not working in a nefarious way,” Singletary said. He said he highlighted the fintech’s community platform and tried to dispel misconceptions customers are being charged exorbitant interest rates. SoLo Funds bills itself as a community finance platform. Its business model has drawn the attention of regulators in a handful of states who view its “tip” structure asa predatory lending practice. In recent years, SoLo hasreached agreements with regulatorsin California, Washington, D.C., Connecticut and Pennsylvania related toallegations borrowers were required to pay large “tips” to access loans through its platform. In May 2024,the Los Angeles-based fintech was suedby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau,then under the Biden administration, also took issue with SoLo’s “tip” structure, which it said obscured the total cost of loans. The CFPB also said SoLo, which marketed itself as a consumer-friendly alternative to pricier, short-term loans, hid from borrowers the option to forgo a tip, and offered loans to borrowers in states that require platforms to have a license. SoLo said it had long since changed some components of its display the CFPB called out in the lawsuit. In February, under the Trump administration, the CFPBdropped the lawsuitagainst SoLo Funds. Russ Vought, the CFPB’s acting director who also leads the OMB, said at the time that the bureau under former director Rohit Chopra “shockingly” tried to “destroy” SoLo, “which incurred millions in legal fees and had to lay off 30% of its workforce.” “It was wrong and we dismissed the case,” Vought said. Prior tojoining SoLo Funds in 2024, Singletary was the director of U.S. government affairs at investing fintech Robinhood. “When SoLo Funds reached out to me to come and work with them,” he said, “it was this opportunity of figuring out, how do I make this fintech work well with regulators? What can I do to strengthen this relationship with this particular fintech and regulators?” That task was made far more difficult when, two weeks after he joined SoLo Funds, the firm was sued by the CFPB. He called that “a very interesting intro into the company,” but said he wasn’t deterred in seeking to make sure the regulator and the fintech understood each other. Then came a “blessing” in the form of the presidential administration change in January, Singletary said. “It was an opportunity for us to state our case in front of a new body, really,” he said. In doing that, the fintech focused on its community of users. “What does this whole community look like? What is this application actually doing? Who is it actually helping?” he said. “The customers are always going to make it make sense for the regulators,” he said. “I highlighted the fact that even though there's misconceptions, that we were facing those and actually working through them.” SoLo Funds became the first company to have a lawsuit dismissed by the current CFPB, which has since dropped a number of lawsuits filed under the Biden administration. “I genuinely think that's because we highlighted the community,” Singletary said. “Bodies really matter” when it comes to cooperation between fintechs and regulators. As the CFPB has reversed course on a number of actions, James has been quick to pick up the mantle in New York. Her officesued Capital Oneover lost interest payments to consumers andsued Early Warningover alleged fraud at Zelle – and initiated both after the CFPB dropped similar lawsuits this year. James’ office has also filed lawsuits against earned wage access providersMoneyLion and DailyPay, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to thousands of workers. Travis Holoway and Rodney Williams, the founders of SoLo Funds, soughtto establish an alternative to costly payday lenders, Singletary said. They“were two college-educated men who had made it, and their friends and family were consistently asking them for loans,” Singletary said. SoLo Funds, which launched in 2018, offers checking accounts and debit cards, and through its loan marketplace, members can request loans that other users can fund. The fintech – which taps Bangor Savings Bank for banking services – has about 2 million customers and 1.8 million deposit accounts, and has facilitated about $1 billion in transactions, Singletary said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ny-ag-james-solo-funds-tips-cfpb-fintech-regulators/806024/,,
Senators back open banking rule,"Several Senate Democrats on Thursday called on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to keep pursuing open banking rules that give consumers the ability to easily shift their personal data from one financial institution to another. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut pressed CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought in a letter seen by Payments Dive to continue the federal agency’s work in writing a rule under the Dodd-Frank Act that would further such consumer rights, without fees. The agency issued such a rule last year during the Biden administration, but bank trade groups sued over the regulation and it has been tied up in court. Under Vought’s leadership, the agency stopped backing the Biden-era rule in the litigation, which a judge has stayed, pending the agency’s decision to rewrite the rule. At the same time, Vought is aggressively shrinking the agency and threatening to shutter it, leaving the rule’s future in doubt. “We are concerned that the Trump CFPB’s policymaking seems to be more driven by the seesawing interests of big banks and other industry groups than with protecting consumers’ rights to their own data, as mandated by law,” the senators wrote in their letter. The senators alsoissued a press releaseThursday, insisting Vought reinstate the priorPersonal Financial Data Rights rule. “In the absence of the rule, big banks have demonstrated that they intend to charge exorbitant fees for this data to choke off competition and concentrate this data in the hands of a few large incumbents,” the senators wrote. The senators also contended that banks should not be allowed to charge for access to the data, saying it would be a violation of the law. “Large financial institutions have a monopoly over large swaths of consumer data and thus have the potential to drive out competitors and start ups in the data sharing market,” the letter said. The senators specifically called out JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, for imposing fees this year on third-party data aggregators, including the fintech Plaid. That bank’s fees were “at rates high enough to paralyze the market,” the letter said, noting that PayPal’s peer-to-peer payment tool Venmo and neobank Chime use Plaid to connect users’ bank accounts to their apps. JPMorgan Chase was set to impose an estimated $300 million in new fees annually on Plaid, the senators said, citing an article from Forbes, before the companies reached an agreement in September on terms that weren’t disclosed. JPMorgan Chase’s initial fee structure “indicates where the market may be moving absent the CFPB’s rule,” the letter said. A second data aggregator, Yodlee, this month said it had reached anupdated agreementwith JPMorgan Chase over access fees. The senators argued that “it is critical that any revisions the CFPB makes to the Personal Financial Data Rights rule recognize the importance of consumers being able to exercise their rights, which includes deciding how and by whom their data is used.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/open-banking-cfpb-warren-wyden-blumenthal-vought-jpmorgan-plaid-chime-venmo-yodlee/806190/,,
Florida credit union to buy Georgia bank,"Jacksonville, Florida-based Community First Credit Union of Florida will buy Waycross, Georgia-based First Southern Bank, creating a $3.3 billion-asset institution, thecredit union announced Tuesday. The deal, which would extend the credit union’s footprint into southeast Georgia and elsewhere into Florida, is thesecond CU-bank tie-up announced this week,after El Paso, Texas-based GECU proposed buying Roswell, New Mexico-based Bank of the Southwest on Monday. “While we love the growth opportunities that come with the transaction, this acquisition is founded on a unified vision between Community First and First Southern Bank,” Sam Inman, CEO of Community First, said in a prepared statement. “Both institutions emphasize a community-oriented and relationship-based approach, maintaining a culture that respects individuals and prioritizes service excellence.” Both institutions are storied: Community First is 90 years old. First Southern is 118 years old. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both institutions, is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2026. After that, First Southern’s holding company will liquidate, dissolve and distribute any remaining assets to its stockholders. The new Community First will count roughly $2.5 billion in loans and $2.9 billion in deposits across 31 branches. “First Southern Bank customers will continue to see their trusted familiar banker at each location,” said First Southern CEO Daniel Hager in a prepared statement. “The newly combined institution will have the ability to offer highly personalized financial services, which will enable us the financial capabilities to support further expansion.” Community First plans to retain all First Southern employees, stretching its headcount to 530. “Combining will expand services and strengthen community impact,” Community First said in a Q&A on its website. Tie-ups between credit unions and banks are not without challengers.Independent Community Bankers of America CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey released a statement Tuesday calling for policymakers “to address the harmful impact these deals have on local communities.” CitingICBA data, Rainey said the deals harm “small businesses and local communities while community banks outperform credit unions in high-poverty areas.” She called for Congress to eliminate the federal tax exemption for credit unions with more than $1 billion in assets. More than 80% of deals since 2010 have involved credit unions of that size, ICBA found. Four in 10 deals have involved a credit union headquartered in a different state than the acquired bank. Small Business Administration lending fell almost 80% at community banks that were acquired by credit unions, according to ICBA, and the amount loaned per approved mortgage application at the institutions decreased 61%. Michael Bell, a partner at Honigman who often architects such deals – including this one – told Banking Dive that ICBA’s statements are without “substance.” “The ICBA equates size to evil for some reason,” he said. “I ask the ICBA, is a $1 billion community bank still a community bank? Should all community banks larger than $1 billion give up the many tax subsidies enjoyed by community banks?”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/florida-credit-union-buy-georgia-bank/805897/,,
White House nominates Vought aide to lead CFPB,"Additionally, Geof Gradler was named deputy director of the CFPB. He’s a former lobbyist who joined the bureau about four months ago, according tohis LinkedIn profile. The CFPB spokesperson declined to comment on the fate of the agency, or whether the bureau intended to make a similar move in another 210 days. Vought said last monthon a podcast that onlyRepublican appointees and a few career employees remain “while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months,” Vought said. Trump administration officials have tried repeatedly this yearto hobble or shutterthe agency but have, at times run into court-ordered roadblocks. The CFPB spokesperson said the hearing process likely will be a moot point for Levenbach. The Senate probably wouldn’t get around to it until next year, the spokesperson said, and with Vought not going anywhere, the formal process may not occur. Michael Emancipator, senior vice president and regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America,noted on LinkedInWednesday that Levenbach’s nomination appears to be “merely a resetting of the clock” under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. And McGuireWoods partner Jeff Ehrlich, a former deputy enforcement director at the CFPB, said the nomination is “likely a placeholder,” according toa LinkedIn post. The spokesperson pointed toa news releasethe bureau issued last week, in which the CFPB said itinformed the court inNTEU v. Voughtthat the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the CFPBcan’t legally request fundsfrom the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB “anticipates having sufficient funds to continue operations until at least December 31,” the release said.DOJ attorneys told the court that available funds are expected to run out in early 2026. Levenbach is also vice chair of theNational Capital Planning Commission, a panel that Voughtthreatened to involvein this summer’s dust-up over an over-budget renovation at the Federal Reserve. Levenbach served as chief of staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during Trump’s first term. Later, he became a senior adviser with the White House National Economic Council and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, according tohis LinkedIn profile. Prior to those roles, he spent about a decade at OMB. “Donald Trump’s sending the Senate a new nominee to lead the CFPB looks like nothing more than a front for Russ Vought to stay on as Acting Director indefinitely as he tries to illegally close down the agency,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a Wednesday statement. “Instead of doing everything in their power to lower costs for Americans, Trump and Vought want to make it easier for giant corporations to scam families out of their money.” Consumer Bankers Association CEO Lindsey Johnson said Levenbach’s nomination “comes at a critical time for consumers and the financial services marketplace.” “America’s leading Main Street banks look forward to continuing to work with the Trump Administration on data-driven, pro-growth policies that will support hardworking Americans and drive the economy forward, while at the same time ensuring the Bureau fulfills its statutory mission and sticks to what Congress authorized it to do,” she said in a Wednesday statement. “This will not only help restore the trust and credibility of the CFPB, but will benefit consumers, industry, and the broader economy alike.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-director-levenbach-vought-omb-trump/805913/,,
LevelField gets state approval to buy Chicago bank,"LevelField filed a fresh application to buy Burling inDecember 2024. In that paperwork, the Houston firm said it would pay roughly $70 million for the bank, which counts a single branch and $209.5 million in assets. The combined entity will be renamed LevelField Bank but maintain Burling’s community banking business. However, it will add a focus on deposit accounts, loans and custody services tailored to digital assets, including term loans and credit cards secured by bitcoin or Ether, according to the application. Burling's CEO, Michael Busch, will become president of LevelField Bank, Grant said. From the beginning, LevelField said it sought to become the first full-service chartered bank to offer traditional banking and digital asset services on one platform across the U.S. ""The idea is, once we have a customer, they don't have to go outside the bank perimeter for anything they want to do in digital assets,” Grant told American Banker. Grant said he expects acquisition to be finalized by the end of this year. Only Burling’s cannabis banking business will retain the Burling brand, LevelField said. To accommodate the anticipated round-the clock needs of its digital-asset user base, LevelField aims to hire roughly 100 employees in 2026 – mostly in customer service, Grant said. Once LevelField receives regulatory approval, it aims to raise $112.5 million, according to its December 2024 filing. That is meant to cover the acquisition of the bank, $20 million in growth capital and $17.5 million that LevelField will retain, the company said. In a release Monday, Grant thanked investors “for backing the patient, disciplined work it took to meet the necessary supervisory standards that protect consumers and businesses and make the U.S. the home of the world leading banking system."" As far as embracing crypto, Grant said the banking system can either ""live in denial or we can try to safely integrate it … in such a way that it works collaboratively and doesn't endanger the system."" “Financial services must be changed from the inside, and unlike other industries, outside disruptors barely move the needle,” Granttold Bloomberg.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/levelfield-acquire-burling-bank-illinois-regulator-approval-crypto-digital-asset/805947/,,
FDIC countersues Capital One over special assessment,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. accused Capital One of paying $99.4 million less than necessary to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund following the 2023 failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, according tocourt documents filed Monday. The FDIC’s lawsuit countered legal action takenin Septemberagainst the regulator by the bank, which alleged the FDICimposed an “outsized and improperly calculated” special assessment fee on Capital One. The FDIC inflated its assessment against Capital One by $149.2 million, the bank said in September. At issue is a $56 billion position between two Capital One subsidiaries which, according to Monday’s lawsuit, Capital One excluded in its reporting of uninsured deposits. Capital One said the agency “erroneously” included the position as uninsured deposits, inflating what the bank owed. The FDIC used funds from the DIF to protect uninsured depositors when banks fail. When SVB and Signature Bank were seized by the FDIC in March 2023, most of their deposits – 88% and 67%, respectively – were above the FDIC’s $250,000 threshold and “uninsured.” To recoup DIF funds later that year, the FDIC implemented a special assessment on the nation’s largest banks, including Capital One. The FDIC argued Monday that Capital One benefits from deposit insurance, and that the funds were “deposits held at the bank for which the subsidiary already received the benefit of FDIC deposit insurance.” ""There are no time machines when it comes to special assessments,” the FDIC said. Capital One and the FDIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fdic-countersues-capital-one-over-special-assessment/805937/,,
JPMorgan Chase enhancing due diligence for clients in the Amazon region,"The change itself does not come with any inherent restrictions on client activities or transactions in the region, but a JPMorgan spokesperson told ESG Dive on Wednesday that each activity and transaction will be considered “on a case-by-case basis, in line with [its] risk appetite and commercial interests.” “Managing risk is critical to the long-term success of our business,” the bank’s spokesperson said in emailed comments. “We added Amazon Biome as one example of a business location associated with clients and/or transactions we consider sensitive or in need of enhanced review, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.” The RAISG geospatial definition, which JPMorgan will use to define the biome, “is widely recommended by Indigenous leaders and activists,” according to Stand.earth. Allison Fajans-Turner, a senior campaigner at the Rainforest Action Network — one of the environmental organizations backing the annual Banking on Climate Chaos reports — said requiring enhanced due diligence for activities in the Amazon biome is “the bare minimum that we should expect from other large backers of Amazon drilling.” “JPMorgan Chase has finally taken an essential — if long-overdue — step to confront its role as the largest financier of oil and gas extraction in the Amazon,” Fajans-Turner said in Stand.earth’s Nov. 13 release. After 30% of JPMorgan’s shareholders supported a proposal to require the bank to issue a report on its practices on Indigenous People's rights in the 2024 proxy season, JPMorgan reached an agreement with shareholders proposing a similar filing in the most recent proxy season. The United Church Fundwithdrew its proposal to the bankin April — afterJPMorgan submitted a no-action requeston the filing — once the bank agreed to add a disclosure stating “the company will consider free, prior and informed consent where risks are identified before proceeding with transactions that may have material implications for Indigenous Peoples.” “Promises on paper to respect Indigenous and human rights and screen clients operating in the Amazon biome fall far short of what’s needed: real financing exclusions applied to the Amazon and other fragile ecosystems and rigorous implementation of human rights protections for Indigenous peoples and all affected local communities,” Fajans-Turner said in the Nov. 13 release. In addition to the Arctic and the Amazon, JPMorgan requires a case-by-case enhanced review for coal mining and coal-fired power activities; clients whose “main business is the physical trading of conflict minerals,” cobalt or diamond trading; and hydropower, agricultural commodities or downstream agricultural commodity use in non-designated countries.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-enhancing-due-diligence-amazon-region-clients-standearth/806007/,,
Investor blasts Comerica over Fifth Third deal,"Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management on Monday probed Comerica’s $10.9 billion deal to be acquired by Fifth Third and threatened legal action against the bank if more information on the deal process isn’t released. Additionally, Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions was Comerica’s first suitor, before the Dallas-based bank struck a deal with Fifth Third,American Bankerreported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Spokespeople for Regions and Fifth Third declined to comment. A Comerica spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July,accusing the regional lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” HoldCo, whichowns about 2.04 million shares of Comerica stock,suggested PNC, Fifth Third or Huntington as possible buyers. In October, Fifth Third said it wasacquiring Comerica for $10.9 billionin stock. Earlier this month,a regulatory filingrevealed that the Cincinnati-based lender was not Comerica’s first suitor. The CEO of another bank, identified as Financial Institution A in the filing, proposed an all-stock transaction with $78 billion-asset Comerica in September. But Comerica’s board determined the terms “were not likely to be more attractive than the consideration that could be offered by another counterparty.” HoldCo’s65-page presentation issued Monday, which parsed recent regulatory filings, alleged a lack of board oversight in Comerica CEO Curt Farmer’s interactions with Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence and the absence of a competitive process in the Fifth Third deal, saying “this isn’t negotiation; it’s surrender.” HoldCo accused Comerica’s board of ignoring Financial Institution A’s proposals, a choice it called “indefensible,” and contended “had you engaged, we believe those ‘preliminary’ bids would have matured into definitive proposals — at likely materially higher levels.” HoldCo also critiqued Farmer’s “windfall” – he’s set to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks – and the deal’s “aggressive” breakup fee of $500 million. The acquisition is set to face a shareholder vote in January. HoldCo demanded a raft of details, calling on Comerica to “provide a more complete and transparent chronology of the events leading up to the Fifth Third transaction.” That includes when the board first discussed potential responses to shareholder pressure and when it authorized Comerica management to explore a merger, as well as information on the identity of Financial Institution A, the timing, substance and financial terms of its proposals, and whether Comerica or its advisers engaged with that bank. “The apparent absence of any follow-up engagement with a bidder who made an offer — combined with the lack of evidence that J.P. Morgan sought to create competition between bidders — suggests a process engineered to favor Fifth Third rather than one designed to maximize shareholder value,” the activist investor said. HoldCo also pressed for details on the decision to hire JPMorgan Chase as Comerica’s financial adviser, and seeks more specifics related to Farmer’s conversations with Spence. “The size and timing of Mr. Farmer’s compensation package strongly indicate a potential conflict of interest — namely, that Fifth Third effectively ‘overpaid’ the CEO to secure a lower purchase price for shareholders,” the activist said. If the bank doesn’t provide the requested detail, “we will have to consider seeking expedited relief in the Delaware Court of Chancery to obtain the disclosures we believe are warranted,” HoldCo said. The activist may also consider bringing fiduciary-duty claims in the Delaware court. In recent months, Regions executives have repeatedly expressed disinterest in acquiring a bank, instead eyeing the opportunity to snag customers and talentamid disruption caused by other M&Aactivity. Regions CFO David Turner reiterated those views this month at theBancAnalysts Association of Boston conference– which would have been after the bank reportedly proposed a deal with Comerica. “We're, I think, the only bank that hadn't done an acquisition since 2006,” Turner said Nov. 7. The bank had just finished its strategic plan, “and M&A is not part of that plan,” he said. “It's just not part of where we want to focus our time and attention. And we understand things can change, but that's just not where we are today,” Turner added. Still, one analyst noted some wonder whether the bank’s position may change. “With increased M&A activity in their Southeast backyard, there have been investors who wonder if [Regions management] would start to feel compelled to take part in the M&A wave, particularly since the company is profitable but has had challenges growing organically,” Truist Securities analyst Brian Finneran wrote in a Tuesday note.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/holdco-activist-comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-regions/805807/,,
Revolut valued at $75B,"Revolut is valued at $75 billion after completing a share sale, theBritish fintech said Monday. Revolut did not disclose how many shares were sold or the amount raised. It’s the fifth share sale Revolut has allowed its staff to date, with the fintech asserting it’s “one of the most liquid employee share programmes across private companies in the industry.” The new valuation marks significant growth sinceRevolut’s $45 billion valuation 15 months ago, which came directly after it received its long-awaitedBritish banking license. Since then, Revolut has entered multiple markets,named a chairof its Western Europe arm and finalized itsbanking license in Mexico. It’s also exploring U.S. growth, with Revolut U.S. CEO Sid Jajodia saying in October thatnabbing a stateside charteris part of the firm’s growth “mission.” “The level of investor interest and our new valuation reflect the strength of our business model, which is delivering both rapid growth and strong profitability,” CFO Victor Stinga said in a prepared statement on the recent share sale. “We welcome onboard a series of world-class investors and look forward to working with them for the next stage in Revolut’s evolution.” The transaction was led by Coatue, Greenoaks, Dragoneer and Fidelity Management & Research Company. Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Andreessen Horowitz, Franklin Templeton and T. Rowe Price Associates also participated. In ablog postMonday, Coatue wrote that it sees Revolut “charting a new path.” “They are building the world’s first global financial super-app, which is now operating in 39 countries and serves over 65 million users,” wrote Brendan O’Boyle, Rohan Bharvani and Lucas Swisher, investors at Coatue, which also led Revolut’s 2024 funding round. “What began as a travel card designed to avoid high [foreign exchange] fees has evolved into a multi-product financial platform that is redefining what modern banking looks like for consumers and businesses.” Revolut’s 2024 revenue grew 72% to $4 billion year over year, with profit before tax more than doubling to $1.4 billion. Its Revolut Business arm hit $1 billion in annualized revenue in 2025, the company said. The new valuation “reflects the remarkable progress we have made in the last twelve months towards our vision of building the first truly global bank, serving 100 million customers across 100 countries,” CEO Nik Storonsky said in a prepared statement.

"Comerica, Fifth Third sued by activist investor","Just days after threatening legal action against Comerica, HoldCo Asset Management has sued the regional bank and its proposed buyer, Fifth Third. The activist investor accused Comerica CEO Curt Farmer of being “focused solely on advancing his own interests” based on the “rushed” way the Dallas-based bank’s proposed$10.9 billion acquisition by Fifth Thirdcame together. Theclass-action complaint, filed Friday in the Delaware Court of Chancery by HoldCo Opportunities Fund, alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by Comerica and its board members related to the transaction and its “draconian” provisions. It also accuses the bank of leaving out material information from disclosures related to the deal. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCo also accused Fifth Third of “aiding-and-abetting” the board in breaching its fiduciary duty. HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July, accusing the lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” In October, Fifth Third announced it would acquire Comerica. HoldCoissued a presentationlast week that picked apart the proposed deal, threatening to take Comerica to court if it didn’t release more information on how the agreement came together. Comerica rebuffed at leastone earlier suitor, Financial Institution A, according to a disclosure. That was Regions Bank, American Banker reported. The deal between Comerica and Fifth Third was “negotiated over an extraordinarily compressed timeline,” HoldCo’s Friday complaint contends. It was driven by Farmer’s “fear of an activist contest” led by HoldCo, “and his fear that no other bidder would keep him on,” the firm alleged. “Fearing for his job, Farmer raced to find a friendly white knight that could provide him with a lucrative post-closing role,” the complaint asserts. Farmer isset to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks. Part of the rush, HoldCo claims, was to avoid any proxy contest at Comerica’s annual meeting, to have been held by May 2026. The Fifth Third deal is projected to close in the first quarter of 2026. Although Comerica received an offer from Financial Institution A, the complaint alleges the Dallas bank decided to “nip those negotiations in the bud” and solely focus on Fifth Third. The deal came together hastily and in a way that ensures “no topping bid could disrupt Farmer’s entrenchment plan,” HoldCo attorneys alleged. The merger agreement carries a “gargantuan” termination fee of $500 million and “an absurdly narrow fiduciary-out” that doesn’t let the board scrap the merger for a higher bid, HoldCo said in the complaint. The “draconian” deal protections mean Comerica’s board couldn’t terminate the acquisition for a better proposal until October 2026, even if shareholders don’t vote in favor of the deal, the filing said. HoldCo also alleges the registration statement is “materially misleading and incomplete” and doesn’t provide shareholders with any details that would allow them to compare the deal’s terms with Financial Institution A’s proposed offers. “There is no evidence from the Registration Statement that Comerica ever made a counterproposal or tried to negotiate for a price above the lowest end of the exchange ratio range in Fifth Third’s initial proposal,” the complaint said. “Nor is there any evidence that Comerica made any attempt to re-engage Financial Institution A (to see if it would provide a better proposal) or solicit interest from other potential bidders.” The 17-day span – from the start of potential merger conversations between Farmer and Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence to when an agreement was signed – “is the shortest timeframe of any of the ten largest bank mergers, with the next shortest taking 43 days and the median taking 67 days,” HoldCo contended. “Such negotiations are more reminiscent of distressed bank sales during the 2008 global financial crisis,” the complaint said. In aresponse filed Monday, attorneys for Comerica argued HoldCo’s views are at odds with those of other bank shareholders, and blasted the activist for “asking this Court to deprive stockholders of a merger after agitating for just such a deal.” Fifth Third’s attorneys, in aseparate Monday filing, called HoldCo’s aiding and abetting assertion a “facially meritless claim.” “This case is only about HoldCo’s self-serving activism goals,” Fifth Third’s attorneys said. Comerica and Fifth Third attorneys accused HoldCo of “gamesmanship” and called its claims weak. Comerica’s lawyers also needled HoldCo for “revel[ing] in its notoriety” after pushing for the bank to sell itself and seeking credit for the outcome. Comerica’s attorneys also noted HoldCo was in communication with the bank’s counsel in the days leading up to filing Friday’s complaint. “At no time during those communications did HoldCo indicate it would be filing a suit to enjoin the deal on Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week,” Comerica’s attorneys said. The shareholder vote on the acquisition is tentatively scheduled for Jan. 6. A hearing was set to be held Tuesday related to a motion to expedite the case. Spokespeople for Comerica and Fifth Third declined to comment. Attorneys withBernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman, the law firm representing HoldCo, didn’t return requests for comment. HoldCo also didn’t respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-sued-activist-investor-holdco/806428/,,
Fulton Financial to buy NJ’s Blue Foundry in $243M deal,"Fulton Financial Corp.will acquire Blue Foundry Bancorpin an all-stock transaction valued at $243 million, the companies announced Monday. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, pushes Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based Fulton into northern New Jersey. The bank gained a presence in the southern part of the state last year with itsacquisition of Republic First. The Philadelphia-based bank had locations in New Jersey and New York before it failed. Acquiring $2.15 billion-asset Blue Foundry, headquartered in Rutherford, New Jersey, gives $32 billion-asset Fulton 21 additional branches in eight counties, including four of the state’s most populous. “The expansion in northern New Jersey aligns with our strategy of growing in our local markets and positions us well to drive organic growth across our commercial, consumer, wealth advisory and mortgage businesses,” Fulton CEO Curtis Myers said in a prepared statement. “The combination of our companies creates an opportunity to leverage Fulton’s robust banking services and provide greater convenience and innovative solutions to an expanded customer base, with a continued focus on supporting our local communities,” he said. Under the terms of the agreement, Blue Foundry investors will receive 0.65 shares of Fulton common stock for each share they own. The transaction’s estimated $243 million value stems from Fulton’s $17.96 share price from Friday. “Joining forces with Fulton is an exciting step forward for our employees, customers and communities,” Blue Foundry CEO James Nesci said in a prepared statement. “This partnership allows us to preserve the local relationships and personalized service our customers value, while gaining access to greater resources and providing more solutions and convenience to customers.” In recent years, Blue Foundry has been a publicly traded bank, during which time it has reported more than $20 million in losses,American Bankerreported. Activist investor Larry Seidman, who had pushed for its sale via proxy campaign last year, told American Banker there was “no question whatsoever” that Fulton would be able to produce better results than Blue Foundry has with its assets. “It's a good bank with good management,” Seidman said of Fulton. “Blue Foundry was horrible. They couldn't make any money.” The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to tangible book value per share. It’s expected to be accretive to first full-year earnings by over 5%, and neutral to regulatory capital ratios at close. As part of the deal, Fulton will make a $1.5 million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation, which provides impact grants to nonprofit community organizations in New Jersey.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fulton-financial-to-buy-nj-blue-foundry-243m-deal/806443/,,
MoneyLion to pay $1.75M to settle CFPB lawsuit,"MoneyLion agreed Friday topay $1.75 millionto settle a long-running lawsuit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, alleging the fintech charged more than the maximum 36% interest rate allowed by the Military Lending Act on loans to service members. The settlement narrows – to 12 – the number of cases the CFPB has in active litigation, based on acount given last weekby a representative of the bureau’s workers union. The CFPB has dismissed 22 enforcement actions this year. The case also bolsters the CFPB’s commitment –from April, and subsequently reinforced in a “humility pledge” Friday – to focus on providing redress to service members, veterans and their families. As part of the settlement, MoneyLion is barred from extending consumer credit at rates higher than 36% to borrowers for whom the MLA cap applies. That includes credit insurance premiums or fees, any fee for a debt cancellation contract or debt suspension agreement, or any fee for a credit-related ancillary product sold as part of a credit transaction. It also includes finance charges, application fees or membership fees. That was a focal point of the CFPB’sSeptember 2022 lawsuitagainst the company. MoneyLion required customers to join a membership program – which carried a monthly fee between $19.99 and $29 – to access the fintech’s low annual percentage rate installment loan product, the bureau said when the suit was first filed. But the company failed to allow borrowers to cancel their memberships until their loans were paid, and in some cases, wouldn’t cancel memberships if the borrower had unpaid membership fees, the CFPB added. Friday’s settlement bars MoneyLion from preventing borrowers from canceling their membership. It also does not permit the fintech to engage in collections activities for past unpaid membership fees, collecting membership fees for periods when memberships were suspended. MoneyLion also can’t prevent borrowers from paying off loans in full by using funds in their credit reserve account, according to the settlement. Nor can the company ding borrowers’ credit scores over unpaid membership fees. Also as part of the settlement, MoneyLion must submit an accurate written compliance report, sworn under penalty of perjury, to the CFPB, detailing the number of borrowers who received redress and the amount paid to each. The settlement covers borrowers who had outstanding MoneyLion loans between December 2017 and October 2024. MoneyLion, in September 2022, disputed the CFPB’s allegations, accusing the regulator of taking a “sensationalist route of prioritizing headlines instead of engaging in constructive dialogue.” “MoneyLion has the highest regard for its military and veteran customers and [is] committed to working with this important community to help them achieve better financial health,” the company said at the time. “MoneyLion is honored to serve this important segment of its customer base and is grateful for the sacrifice these men and women have made for our country.” The membership offering represents a small subset of MoneyLion’s business, the company said at the time. Since then, the fintech has come under new management: MoneyLionwas acquired this yearby Gen Digital forabout $1 billion. The CFPB is also not the only entity with a consumer-protection case against MoneyLion.New York’s attorney generalsued MoneyLion and fellow earned wage access provider DailyPay in April, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to tens of thousands of workers with fees that “amount to outrageous annual interest rates in the triple digits.” Thecity of Baltimorelast month sued MoneyLion, alleging the company misled and manipulated consumers into taking out small-dollar, short-term loans that come with high fees. MoneyLion in 2023 persuaded the judge in the CFPB case topause proceedingsahead of aSupreme Court rulingthat affirmed the bureau’s funding structure is constitutional.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-moneylion-settlement-mla-interest-rate-36-cap-military-membership-fees/806439/,,
U.S. Bank hires up for greater Southeast growth,"After adding bankers to serve businesses in Dallas and Houston, U.S. Bank is now focused on further expansion across the Southeast, a business banking executive said. Within the next six months, U.S. Bank plans to hire at least a dozen bankers in a couple of Southeast states where it doesn’t have branches, said Dee O’Dell, head of business banking sales at the Minneapolis-based lender. He didn’t elaborate, butthat group includesAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. The super-regional bank has recently added teams of bankers in markets where it’s seeing greater growth opportunity, including a second team in Charlotte, North Carolina; a second in Las Vegas; and a fourth in Chicago, O’Dell said during a recent interview. In his unit, about 250 people have been hired into new roles this year. In Houston, where the $695 billion-asset bank announced last week it added a business banking team, four people have been hired and the lender plans to bring on two more, he said. In U.S. Bank’s business banking segment, which serves companies generating between $2.5 million to $50 million in annual revenue, about 1,200 employees across the country serve about 75,000 clients, O’Dell said. The consumer and business banking segmentmakes up about 32%of the lender’s overall revenue, which was $21.3 billion year to date,as of Sept. 30. U.S. Bank provides those commercial clients with different types of credit for their capital needs, including conventional financing, owner-occupied real estate loans and Small Business Administration loans. Clients in that size range often “not only have their primary business, but they're looking for ways to diversify,” O’Dell said. “They not only want to own the building they're in, they may want to own some other buildings as well, and so we've got the ability to provide capital for them, not only for their core business, but for investment real estate.” Bankers also seek to connect clients with other U.S. Bank services, such as credit cards, merchant processing, treasury management, foreign exchange and wealth management. Amid a highly competitive landscape, the lender has sharpened efforts to offer anddeliver services to clientsin a comprehensive way, O’Dell said. “Our approach has been to integrate all that together so that there is value that comes from having all of that in one place,” he said. To zero in on where businesses could gain the most benefit, the bank developed – along with a fintech O’Dell wouldn’t name – a proprietary diagnostic tool for companies. The questionnaire assesses business needs and money movement, diagnoses the level of efficiency in those functions and has a team review results with business clients. “The idea is that instead of trying to sell any one of those products, we're approaching it in a much more consultative and holistic way,” O’Dell said. “It helps our clients see how they can be even more efficient, save time in their day, eliminate risk of fraud, other things like that.” That diagnostic effort has bolstered the bank’s success rate in serving new clients since it was introduced nearly two years ago, O’Dell said. “Sometimes our bankers will meet with a company that we don't bank with today. And if your question is, ‘Do you need any banking services?’ The answer might be, ‘No, no, everything's fine. It's all good,’” O’Dell said. “If we can get them to engage with us and have this conversation and fill out this basic template questionnaire, we can go back and provide insights. And often, it opens up a conversation where companies don't even realize the things that they are doing or not doing that could lead to so much greater efficiency.” Another newer internal tool aggregates data to give bankers a view of companies or prospects within the markets they serve, allowing them to sort by sales size, industry type or ownership of property, so they can better target clients based on potential needs, O’Dell said. SBA loans may be a prime option for some of those businesses and that’s an area of lending U.S. Bank seeks to grow further, since it can serve as a company’s entry point into the bank. U.S. Bank has doubled its SBA lending in the past two years, O’Dell said. In fiscal 2025, the bank totaled $871.2 million in SBA 7(a) loans, up 23% from the previous fiscal year,it said last month. “We've been able to use that program to help a number of companies, individuals get capital they wouldn't otherwise be able to get, and because of the way that we approach that, and our client selection in that, the loss ratio that we've had in that space has been very attractive to our shareholders,” O’Dell said. SBA lending can be ideal in some succession situations, O’Dell noted. The segment of businesses O’Dell oversees has a significant number of owners nearing the end of their careers, so the bank also aims to jump on the chance to be involved in those moments. In cases where a business owner doesn’t have a child who wants to take over, they may look to sell to a similar company or private equity firm. Or if there’s someone in the company who’s interested in acquiring it but doesn’t have the capital, the bank can use an SBA loan to help with that pursuit. “We see great opportunities to help the next generation of business owners acquire business and a current generation who are at the end of their careers, exit, monetize what they've invested in, and have this sense that their legacy will continue,” O’Dell said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/us-bank-adding-business-bankers-southeast-odell/806212/,,
VALT Bank applies for de novo charter,"A group of former U.S. Bank executives is seeking federal approval to establish VALT Bank, applications submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Nov. 13 show. The proposed bank, headquartered in Eagle, Idaho, will be fully digital and will focus on serving “digitally demanding small to midsized businesses” in the U.S., according to its application. VALT plans to offer credit and deposit products as well as treasury and cash management services, and plans to provide clients with SMB-focused automation solutions. The bank will be led by proposed director, CEO and President Matt Gediman, whose nearly two-decade U.S. Bank career culminated in three years as a managing director in the bank’s private wealth management business. “When we refer to ‘digitally demanding SMBs,’ we mean revenue-generating small and midsized businesses that use technology across their daily operations and expect the same level of technological fluency from their financial service providers,” Gediman told Banking Dive via email Monday. These are traditional businesses, he added – not tech firms or crypto companies. VALT does not plan to interact with digital assets. “Our customers are established SMBs that simply expect modern, reliable, integrated digital banking,” he said. “[O]ur model is designed to support them by making banking uncomplicated, accessible, and integrated with digital tools to run their businesses more efficiently,” he said. Former U.S. Bank Vice Chairman John Elmore is VALT’s proposed executive chair and Ross Carey, former U.S. Bank EVP of business banking and SBA division, is its proposed vice chair. Kim Hoyt, attorney at Salem, Oregon-based law firm Garrett Hemann Robertson, and Dana Johnson, president and chief investment officer at single-family office MidAmerica Capital Partners, are VALT’s additional proposed directors. The OCC declined to comment on the application, and the FDIC did not respond immediately to a request for comment. But the heads of both agencies have recently spoken in favor of increased de novo chartering. Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gouldtold Banking Dive last monththat one of his major goals while at the helm of the OCC is “invigorating de novo chartering in America.” Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hillnoted earlier this year that new bank formationhas “fallen off a cliff” in recent years. At the American Bankers Association’s Washington Summit in April, he noted that 412 new banks were formed in 1984 alone, and that the lowest number of new banks established in any year between 1995 and 2007 was 93. By comparison, just 86 new banks have been formed since 2010, Hill said, and more than half of them came between 2019 and 2022 when Trump appointee Jelena McWilliams ran the FDIC. The OCC and the FDIC have received a number of bank applications since President Donald Trump took office again in January. Applicants includingCoinbaseandStripe-owned Bridgeseek national trust charters, which do not allow for lending or taking insured deposits. One bank – Erebor Bank, which applied for a de novo charter in June – has received conditional approval under Gould’s leadership. Its conditional approval wasgranted in October. TheOCC leasing manualindicates that the agency should make decisions on a charter application within 120 days of receiving it, lining VALT up for an answer by mid-March. Gediman, for VALT’s part, said the team’s intention is to “build a safe, well-governed institution that meets the needs of modern business owners through a unique digital-first experience.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/valt-bank-applies-for-de-novo-charter/806295/,,
CFPB can’t ignore judge’s order: workers union,"Lawyers for a workers unionurged a federal courtSunday to clarify apreliminary injunctionto ensure that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau leaders don’t shutter the agency by refusing funding. “The defendants have filed a ‘notice’ announcing that they intend to allow the Bureau to run out of funding, and when it does, they will stop complying with the Court’s injunction,” attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union wrote Sunday. “Parties may not simply declare that an injunction no longer applies.” The CFPB this monthalertedthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it “anticipates exhausting its currently available funds in early 2026.” At issue is the definition of “combined earnings.” The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel sent a memo to CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought on Nov. 7, asserting that it interprets earnings – from which the Federal Reserve derives the CFPB’s operating budget – as profit rather than revenue. By that math, the Fed has operated at a loss since 2022. NTEU attorneys asserted Sunday that the Fed earns “billions of dollars a year – from interest on loans and securities, and fees assessed” on banks. But because the Fed has raised interest rates since 2022, its combined interest expenses have exceeded combined earnings. The plaintiffs cite congressional testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told lawmakers the central bank examined that balance “very carefully” and concluded the law is “very clear” that the Fed must fund the CFPB even when its expenses exceed its earnings. Further, NTEU attorneys said, the OLC memo “admits, nobody – not any court, not the Fed, and not the CFPB – has ever interpreted” combined earnings as it suggested this month. “Both the Fed and the CFPB (until Vought needed a mechanism to circumvent this Court’s injunction) have consistently understood ‘combined earnings’ to mean, simply, everything the Fed earns,” NTEU attorneys wrote. The OLC’s interpretation relies on “technical definitions from corporate accounting,” NTEU attorneys wrote. “But the Fed is not a private corporation. It sets monetary policy for the United States. … The only reason to adopt its reading of ‘combined earnings’ is to shut down the CFPB.” Vought, in an appearance last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” indeed said of the CFPB: “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within thenext two, three months.” The bureau last week indicated it istransferring all of its active litigationto the DOJ. By the OLC’s logic, NTEU attorneys wrote, Congress would have passed a Dodd-Frank Act “that forces the Federal Reserve Board to choose between increasing interest rates to combat inflation and funding the CFPB.” “Fortunately, that is not the law that Congress wrote,” the attorneys asserted, blasting the CFPB for not choosing another path. “Rather than asking this Court to modify its injunction (which would require them to demonstrate that it should), the defendants have chosen to just ‘inform’ the Court that they ‘do not understand’ the injunction to bind them once the CFPB runs out of money – even if that’s because they decided not to ask the Fed for funding,” NTEU attorneys wrote. Outside of the courtroom, the CFPB on Friday issued what it termed a “humility pledge” meant to be read aloud by bank examiners to banks before exams. The statement drills down on the bureau’snarrowing of focustoward consumer threats that harm service members, veterans and their families and reiterates that the bureau will “avoid, where possible, duplication of supervision, where States or other regulators are already doing that job.” The bureau pledges shorter examination times – reduced from eight weeks to a period “commensurate with the defined scope of exams.” “No longer will the Bureau ask for expansive data sets or other information which may seem unrelated to the exam or include information inconsistent with Bureau priorities,” the pledge reads. “Any follow-up requests by examiners will first be discussed with an entity and will be tailored to the scope of the exam and the information already received from the entity.” The CFPB states its goal as “[to] work collaboratively with the entities to review entities’ processes for compliance and/or remedy existing problems,” emphasizing self-reporting and encouraging banks to resolve issues with the CFPB’s supervision unit, rather than enforcement. That may lend credence to a narrative, from an all-hands meeting of enforcement staff, in which the bureau’s acting enforcement chief said all 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation at the end of the year. Curiously, perhaps, the pledge encourages banks, if they find their exam experience to be “inconsistent with these principles,” to reach out via email to a designated CFPB supervisory official or the bureau’s chief legal officer. In apost Monday on the NTEU’s website, union member Alexis Goldstein asked, “Why is Russell Vought showing the world his weird, creepy pledge of allegiance to big corporations?” Another union member, Doug Wilson, notes a passage in the pledge in which the bureau asserts that examiners will be “encouraged and incentivized to complete the work promptly and under budget.” “This memo doesn't add up,” Wilson wrote. “Vought’s stopped all supervision exams in 2025, refuses to fund CFPB and says he’s shutting us down by 2026. So how will we supervise banks in 2026 if CFPB is closed? How can bank exams be ‘under budget’ if there is no budget?” In an emailed press release to accompany the humility pledge, the CFPB characterized the bureau’s Biden-era supervision efforts as “thuggery,” calling out ex-supervision chief LoreleiSalas as “a former [Democratic donor George] Soros activist who wasput on leave in February 2025.” Further, bureau leadership labeled the pre-Trump supervision unit as “a weaponized arm of the CFPB.” In aLinkedIn post, Allison Preiss, who until February served as senior adviser to the CFPB director, said the humility pledge “might be better characterized as a humiliation pledge.” “The notion that federal employees should genuflect, trembling, before a Wells Fargo or Bank of America, is some of the most ridiculous nonsense I've read all week,” she wrote. In anotherLinkedIn post, Tyler Creighton, counsel at the CFPB, took issue with the idea that the bureau is calling out examiners’ past conduct. “Supervision's workers have always conducted examinations professionally, efficiently, conscientiously, and with a focus on remedying consumer harm,” he wrote. “We will continue to do so, just as soon as Donald Trump and Russell Vought end the nearly 10-month suspension of examinations and let us get back to work for the American people.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-humility-pledge-supervision-enforcement-bank-examiners-fed-funding-refuse-vought-court/806314/,,
Stripe faces bank charter pushback,"A national trust banking charter would let the digital payments giant Stripe offer banking services while sidestepping certain regulations, an advocacy organization opposingthe payment provider's charter applicationargued in a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency this month. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition alsosaid in the letterthat the charter would give Stripe legitimacy that it does not deserve, pointing to the fintech’s history of legal trouble. Stripe, whichacquired a stablecoin infrastructure companycalled Bridge this year, proposes to name the bank Bridge National Trust. “The OCC must reject Stripe’s application for a national trust bank charter due to serious concerns regarding Stripe’s disregard for enforcement, governance, compliance, and consumer protection laws,” according to the Nov. 13 letter, which is addressed to Sebastian Astrada, the agency’s director for licensing of novel banks. The NCRC is a coalition of hundreds of U.S. community-based organizations which run the gamut from faith-based nonprofits to social justice advocates. The organization posted the letter on its website last week. Bridgeapplied for the charter in October. The charter would give Bridge and its parent company the right to provide custody, stablecoin issuance, and management of stablecoin reserves within a federal framework, rather than through state-to-state money transmitter licenses. Spokespeople for Stripe did not respond to messages seeking comment about the NCRC’s letter. If the charter is approved, Bridge would form the Bridge National Trust Bank, to be headquartered in New York City, according tothe Oct. 14 application. CEO Patrick Collison co-founded Stripe along with his brother John Collison, who is president of the business. “We’ve long believed stablecoins will be a core, regulated building block,” Bridge co-founder Zach Abrams wroteon the social media platform Xlast month. “This regulatory infrastructure will enable us to tokenize trillions of dollars and make this future possible.” The crypto firmsCircle,Paxos,RippleandCoinbasehave also applied for charters through the OCC, although none of those applications has been approved yet. With the trust, Stripe could also facilitate payments without supervision from the Federal Reserve, the NCRC said in its letter. “Granting these firms limited purpose trust charters would blur the statutory boundaries of what constitutes a bank, undermine the credibility of the national charter, and heighten systemic risk by allowing them to operate under a lighter regulatory regime,” the group wrote. The coalition also outlines some of the lawsuits and legal action taken against Stripe. In 2020, for example, the Massachusetts attorney general found Stripe had facilitated payments for a fraudulent cryptocurrency operation due to subpar risk monitoring and fraud prevention systems. The companyagreed to pay $120,000and improve its fraud control and employee training. The letter also lists several lawsuits against the company alleging, among other things, that Stripe failed to ensure customer privacy and protect customer data.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/stripe-faces-bank-charter-pushback/806315/,,
How the open banking rule skidded,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said this month it cannot draw funding to continue operations when its current funds lapse, presenting the agency a number of challenges in formulating an open banking rule quickly. The CFPBtold a federal courtNov. 11 that the Justice Department had concluded that the bureau cannot “lawfully draw funds” from the Federal Reserve System – which Congress designated as its funding source – and that the agency has funds to operate until year’s end. The bureau’s notice did not specify what would happen then, although the CFPB’s acting director, Russ Vought, has assailed the agency in the past and spoke publicly in October about itsclosure within months. The bureau has been working on a new open banking rule since July, when it told a federal court it would “substantially”revise the ruleand was granted a litigation stay of a lawsuitfiled last yearby banking trade groups. The CFPB did not respond to an email Monday seeking comment on the rule. Last week, the bureau notified employees that it wouldtransfer its litigation workto the DOJ and planned additional furloughs at year’s end. In its motion for a stay, the bureau told U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves it planned “an accelerated rulemaking process” to address what it considered to be deficiencies with the prior rule, enacted under the Biden administration. But any proposed rule with significant changes – such as allowing financial institutions to charge fees for access to customers’ data – would also require the bureau to assess the impacts to small businesses under the federal Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, attorneys noted. At that point, a public comment period on the proposed rule – typically 30 to 90 days – would begin. The CFPB would then consider those comments and issue a final rule. However, the bureau is considering skipping some parts of the rulemaking process to issue a rule by year’s end, potentially including a public comment period on its proposed rule,Bloomberg Law reportedThursday, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. “Given the polarized view of these rules by the banking and FinTech sectors, if either constituency objects to the substance of the CFPB’s revisions, additional litigation could ensue,” an attorney with law firm McGlinchey Stafford, Adam Maarec, wrote in a Septemberalertabout the process. “An ‘accelerated rulemaking’ still takes a long time,” added Maarec, who advises fintechs and banks. The prior rule took CFPB staff four years from the rulemaking notice to a final rule, he noted, adding “the scope of issues here seems significantly narrower.” Banking groups that sued the bureau last year leaned heavily on the Administrative Procedure Act for their complaint, arguing that the agency had overstepped its authority to impose “a complicated, costly, and fundamentally insecure mandatory data-sharing framework” that did not allow banks to recover their costs. Last month, Reeves issued apreliminary injunctionpreventing the bureau from enforcing its rule, pending the revised rule the CFPB is formulating. A spokesperson for the Bank Policy Institute said Monday the organization understands that the bureau’s rulemaking process is moving forward but declined to comment further, directing other queries to the agency. The Financial Data and Technology Association, which counts data aggregators Plaid and Yodlee as members, said it continues to oppose any effort allowing banks to impose fees for customer data. Both Plaid and Yodlee have announced agreements with the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase, in the past two months that include new fees for data access. The Dodd-Frank Act does not permit fees, which are “a competitive toll on consumers simply for exercising their right to access and share their own financial information,” FDATA Executive Director Steve Boms said Monday in an emailed statement. “If banks are given the green light to impose those fees in a new rule, it would fundamentally shift control of financial data away from consumers and toward already powerful incumbents.” A spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association declined to comment Friday on the CFPB’s future or rule process, as did the American Fintech Council on Monday. Vought, who also leads the Office of Management and Budget, has been trying todramatically downsizethe CFPB’s workforce and mission since he was appointed acting director in February. “We don’t have anyone working there except our Republican appointees and a few career [employees] that are doing statutory responsibilities while weclose down the agency,” Vought said last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months.” Conservative lawmakers and interest groups have targeted the bureau since Congress formed it 15 years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. “The CFPB is a highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency. It is unconstitutional,” the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote in its “Project 2025Mandate for Leadership” document, in a chapter written by Robert Bowes, ahousing department officialin the first Trump administration and a former Chase Manhattan banking executive. “The next conservative President should order the immediate dissolution of the agency — pull down its prior rules, regulations and guidance, return its staff to their prior agencies and its building to the General Services Administration.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-open-banking-rule-skidded-fintechs-banks-vought-court/806436/,,
Ex-Truist employee sentenced in ‘complex’ check-cashing scheme,"A former Truist branch employee is one of eight Georgia residents sentenced in a counterfeit check-cashing scheme that involved stolen check information, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgiasaid Wednesday. The “complex” check-cashing and kickback scheme ran from at least November 2021 to December 2022, prosecutors said. At the time, Mariarlene Brown, aka “Mati Mom,” 44, of Valdosta, worked at a Truist branch in that city. In conspiring with Brown and others to commit bank fraud, William Allen Roberts, 27, of Valdosta, unlawfully obtained check information from Vincent Galliard, 41, of Sumter, South Carolina. Galliard was a former U.S. Postal Service employee in South Carolina who sold checks he stole from the mail, prosecutors said. Roberts used the check information provided by Galliard to produce fraudulent checks. Six others involved in the scheme recruited people to open Truist bank accounts and then got those people to provide their new Truist debit card and account information to those behind the scheme, “with the understanding that they would be paid for doing so,” prosecutors said. That group of co-conspirators included Frederick Pernell Green, 27; Thomas Christopher Mitchell, 31; Calvin Dewayne McKeithen, aka “Supa,” 26; Dewayne Rasheen Butler, aka “Guwapo,” 26; Tyler Khershad Jones, aka “LA Clippers,” 24; and Davontay Wiseman, aka “Vonn,” 28. Those six then passed the account information on to Roberts, who would write checks to those individuals in various amounts. Roberts, with Brown’s help, deposited checks into those accounts, and Brown made sure Roberts could withdraw cash from the accounts, according to prosecutors. Roberts paid Brown for her help in the scheme, as well as the co-conspirators and account holders, prosecutors said. Green, Roberts, Mitchell, McKeithen, Jones, Butler and Wiseman kept most of each check that was deposited, prosecutors said. Text messages the group members exchanged described the conspiracy, and investigators also discovered photos of debit cards, account numbers, fraudulent checks, cash obtained from the check deposits “and a custom-made diamond ring in the shape of the Truist logo worn by Green,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Brown was sentenced to 33 months in prison, five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $390,475.84 in restitution to Truist on Oct. 9, after she pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Seven others – all except Galliard – also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, were sentenced to prison time and ordered to pay Truist restitution in the same amount. Galliard pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a South Carolina case and was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison, along with five years of supervised release, prosecutors said. Galliard was ordered to pay $149,692.14 in restitution divided among The Citizens Bank, First Citizens Bank, South Atlantic Bank, TD Bank, The Conway National Bank and Bank of America, according toa court filing. “Individuals who participate in check-cashing and kickback schemes will face imprisonment and other penalties,” U.S. Attorney Will Keyes said in the press release. “Investigators from the Secret Service and the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office worked to unravel this criminal network, ultimately preventing further theft and helping us ensure accountability for the defendants.” Bank regulators seek to bolster their efforts to address check fraud, which has grown “substantially” in the past several years, Michelle Bowman, the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision,said in June. Although check use has dropped, check fraud hasn’t diminished in tandem. “Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of real or attempted check fraud transactions grew nearly fourfold, even as the number of checks paid fell by more than 18 percent from 2018 to 2021,”the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantareported this year.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ex-truist-employee-sentenced-check-cashing-scheme/806169/,,
Citi CFO Mark Mason to step down in March,"Citi CFO Mark Mason, arguably the highest-profile Black executive at a U.S.-based global systemically important financial institution, will step down from his role in early March, the bankannounced Thursday. At that point, Gonzalo Luchetti, now the bank’s head of U.S. personal banking, will become CFO. Mason, meanwhile, will transition to executive vice chair and senior executive adviser to Citi CEO Jane Fraser, but he intends to pursue leadership opportunities outside the bank by the end of 2026, according to the announcement. In his adviser role, Mason will help Citi prepare for its investor day May 7 and give guidance on the bank’s strategic initiatives. Mason has been a key figure in Citi’stwo-year reorganization, in which the bank set out to simplify its structure,trim its headcount by 20,000employees by 2026, and embrace tech modernization meant to free it fromtwo 2020 consent orders. Citi launched further reorganization Thursday, saying it would integrate its retail bank into its wealth business. The move arguably hands more responsibility to wealth chief Andy Sieg. The bank’s U.S. Everyday Banking, Citi Priority, Citigold and Citigold Private Client labels will be consolidated into a single group led by Kate Luft. Luft, who has served as head of U.S. retail bankingsince April, will add “and Citigold” to her title and report to Sieg. With the move, “U.S. Personal Banking” will no longer be one of Citi’s five core businesses, the company said. But it will be replaced by “U.S. Consumer Cards,” which will combine the bank’s branded cards and retail services businesses under Pam Habner. Habner, who has served as Citi’s head of branded cards and lendingsince 2020, will join the bank’s executive management team and report directly to Fraser. “This evolution of our leadership team and structure is well timed as it puts in place our next generation of leaders ahead of our upcoming Investor Day, when we will lay out our plans to further grow our returns,” Fraser said Thursday in a statement. “We are ending the year with momentum and confidence.” Mason’s upcoming transition comes less than a month after Citi threw added support behind Fraser,naming her chairand giving her a $25 million equity award meant to keep her in place for years to come. Fraser on Thursday called Mason “an invaluable partner” who “models integrity, drive and commitment no matter the circumstances, and has always put the firm first.” “Mark has proven himself to be a leader for all seasons, having helped Citi navigate some of our most challenging times and being a driving force behind the results we are now seeing in our performance and our Transformation,” Fraser said, citing the capitalized term the bank gives its tech modernization. Mason joined Citi in 2001 and has been CFO since 2019 – but between those benchmarks has served as CEO of Citi’s private bank, CEO of Citi Holdings, and CFO of the bank’s Institutional Clients Group, according to hisLinkedIn profile. “Serving as CFO for the last seven years and contributing to a leadership team that is redefining expectations for Citi stands as one of the most demanding and fulfilling chapters of my career,” Mason said in a statement Thursday. “I know that Gonzalo will work tirelessly with the strong team we’ve built across Finance to further Citi’s momentum, and I am fully committed to his smooth transition into the new role.” Scott Siefers, a managing director and senior research analyst for Piper Sandler, called Mason’s departure “an unfortunate loss” for Citi. “Thankfully, he will be succeeded by an insider with deep experience,” Siefers wrote in a note seen by Banking Dive. Luchetti joined Citi in 2006 and has served, among other roles, as consumer banking chief for Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and as global head of wealth management and insurance, according to hisLinkedIn profile. He became head of U.S. personal banking in 2021 and on Thursday earned plaudits from Fraser for expanding his segment’s return on tangible common equity to 14.5% for 2025’s third quarter. “I knew exactly what we needed in our next CFO to build on Mark’s successful tenure,” Fraser said. “In addition to the table-stakes requirement of superb financial acumen, it must be someone who is strategically minded, data-driven, analytical, and an excellent operator. … Gonzalo is that person.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-mark-mason-cfo-step-down-march-gonzalo-luchetti-fraser-sieg-luft-habner/806137/,,
Wells Fargo taps Saul Van Beurden to scale AI,"Saul Van Beurden, chief executive of Wells Fargo consumer and small business banking,has been tappedto scale artificial intelligence at the bank, the lender said Thursday. Additionally, the bank’s CEO for consumer lending, Kleber Santos, will take on added responsibilities as co-CEO of consumer lending and banking as Wells formally combines the businesses, allowing Van Beurden to focus more on AI. “Generative and agentic AI will reshape competitive dynamics across every industry, and we are embracing these tools as we have embraced robotic process automation and machine learning for years,” Wells CEO Charlie Scharf said in a prepared statement. In August, Wells gave branch bankers, investment bankers, customer relations and corporate teamsaccess to AI agents and toolsfrom Google Cloud. The tools help employees sort through massive loads of documentation and provide real-time market insights, among other things. Wells is among banks in a near-ubiquitous industry pushtoward AI-fueled efficiencies. Wells has trained some 90,000 employees on AI this year, deployed AI tools to many others and is now broadening its uses, Scharf said. “Our employees and customers have powerful models in their hands. They expect the same at work,” Van Beurden toldForbesthis month on AI. “GenAI helps remove simple repetitive tasks, builds workflows and frees people to do higher-value work. We are scratching the surface.” The key is to deploy AI in ways that “enhance human performance rather than replace it,” he told Forbes. In his enhanced role, Van Beurden will help leaders in Wells’ businesses oversee transformation in their own segments, Scharf said in a prepared statement. “Success will be driven by business heads embracing these new technologies and rethinking their own operating models using generative and agentic AI solutions,” Scharf said. The advances in AI, he added, “have given us a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform how we work and we are excited by what we can deliver for our employees, customers and communities.” Van Beurden joined Wells in2019 from JPMorgan Chase, where he was chief information officer of consumer and community banking. The San Francisco-based bankelevated him in 2023from head of technology to CEO of consumer and small-business banking.

CFPB is transferring its cases to DOJ,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is transferring all of its active litigation to the Justice Department, according to separate statements Thursday from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, and the workers union representing the agency. Further, Mike Salemi, the CFPB’s acting enforcement chief, said at an all-hands meeting Thursday that, as he understood it, all bureau employees would be furloughed at the end of the year,Government Executivereported, citing people familiar with the matter. Salemi hedged, saying he was not privy to all of the plans, but that the information came from an associate general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget who also serves as a senior legal adviser at the CFPB. The timeline, if true, would dovetail with a projection CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought made in a podcast appearance last month, when he said the only employees left at the bureau were “our Republican appointees and a few career [staff] that are doing statutory responsibilities while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the nexttwo, three months,” Vought said. Further, DOJ attorneys filed paperwork last week with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, indicating the CFPB “anticipates exhaustingits currently available funds in early 2026.” The filing was meant to flag a “potential lapse in appropriations” to pay the bureau’s operating expenses. The court this year granted apreliminary injunctionpreventing the CFPB from firing the vast majority of its staff. Included in the filing was a memo the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel sent Vought, asserting that the bureau may not legally request funds at this time from the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. Salemi on Thursday said the 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation, according to Government Executive. A few top officials may have the opportunity to work for DOJ,American Bankerreported, citing people who were part of the all-hands call. Salemi noted that the DOJ stood up an enforcement and affirmative litigation unit within its Civil Division in September. Salemi told CFPB staff he assumed the agency’s work would be routed there beginning in 2026, according to Government Executive. Cat Farman, president of the National Treasury Employees Union 335, which represents CFPB employees, said Vought has “no legal authority” to transfer the bureau’s cases to the DOJ. “This is Russ Vought’s latest illegal power grab in his ongoing plan to shut down the CFPB,” Farman said in a statement on theNTEU’s website. However, the Dodd-Frank Act indicates the DOJ has the authority to handle cases where no agency is designated to do so by law,Bloomberg Lawreported. Before the CFPB was established in 2011, the DOJ took cases under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act because no other agency had the power. The CFPB is still litigating 13 cases, Farman said, though Vought this year has dismissed 22 enforcement actions brought by the bureau under previous administrations. “CFPB attorneys are afraid DOJ will dismiss [the remaining] cases,” Farman said. The DOJ declined to comment. The CFPB didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Warren, the senator credited as the architect of the bureau, appeared to hold tight to her suspicions. “Donald Trump and Russ Vought are racing to shut down the CFPB while their lawyers tell the courts the opposite,”Warren wrotein a statement Thursday. “Nobody is fooled about the Trump-Vought end game, and the courts must uphold the law.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-transfer-litigation-doj-enforcement-furloughs-salemi-vought/806193/,,
"TD illegally targeted, fired Chinese-heritage employees: lawsuit","Five former TD Bank employees of Chinese heritage say the bank illegally fired them in the wake of TD’s fentanyl-tied money laundering scandal,court documents show. Plaintiffs Andrew Wong, Ka Po Wong, Anne Louie, April Ng and Millie Su allege that TD “intentionally targeted and disproportionately impacted the bank’s Chinese and Chinese American employees” to placate investigators as they probed the lender’santi-money laundering control issues, and to “give the appearance of robust AML procedures.” The bank’s “robust enforcement” went “far beyond the normal scope” in investigating the employees’ personal transaction histories, particularly cash exchanges that moved through their bank accounts, the plaintiffs said. Chinese families traditionally borrow money from family and friends, rather than banks, and it’s common for family members to gift funds for large purchases, such as a house, plaintiffs said, citing a “financial culture [that] is prevalent in the Chinese diaspora, including the Chinese-American community.” The investigators did not take that into account, the plaintiffs asserted. In one instance, investigators pressed Ng on a $500 transaction in new bills meant as a gift during Chinese New Year, a custom. In another, investigators questioned Su about $15,000 in cash she received from family members. The funds, intended as a house down payment gift to a family associate, were deposited into Su’s account. She added $5,000 from her account, and wrote the associate a $20,000 check. “The targeted Chinese and Chinese American employees provided proof that transactions questioned by TD were legitimate, yet each still suffered the most severe adverse employment action possible. They were terminated,” plaintiffs allege. “More callously, the terminated Chinese and Chinese American were demarketed from TD Bank. TD closed their personal and business accounts, and, upon information and belief, barred them from banking with TD in the future.” Prior to the fentanyl-tied AML investigation, TD “leveraged the national origin of its Chinese and Chinese American employees to foster trust in the Chinese community and build their business,” plaintiffs said. During the investigation, however, TD’s Chinese and Chinese American employees “were then targeted by the bank because of their ethnicity and national origin. They were punished for crimes committed by other Chinese individuals — crimes they were not involved in by individuals they did not know.” “Their Chinese heritage, once used by TD Bank to garner trust in the Chinese community, now became a target for TD,” plaintiffs said. Due to TD’s investigations of its Chinese and Chinese American employees in the New York City’s Chinatown branches alone, at least 22 employees were terminated or subject to adverse employment actions, the lawsuit asserted. All but one of the terminated employees were of Chinese origin. At least one employee was terminated for a transaction with a Chinese American employee, according to court documents. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement at their respective jobs, back pay and emotional damages sustained as a result of TD’s conduct. A TD spokesperson told Banking Dive that the bank has no comment, given that the litigation is pending.

Capital One joins FedNow,"Capital One joined the Federal Reserve’s instant payments system FedNow this week, leaving Bank of America and Truist among the major U.S. financial institutions not participating in that real-time ecosystem. Capital One started its FedNow participation Tuesday, a spokesperson for the bank said by email. “Financial Institutions of all sizes are rapidly enabling instant payments for their accountholders,” U.S. Faster Payments Council CEO Reed Luhtanen said by email, when asked for comment on how the system is developing. “The ability to offer instant money movement is becoming table stakes in our 21st century economy, and financial institutions that don’t have a faster payments strategy need to develop one, and fast.” A spokesperson for Bank of America didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson confirmed late last month that the bank had not yet joined FedNow. FedNow has attracted all but two of theeight biggest U.S. retail banks, according to a list of participants on theFederal Reserve’s FedNow website. The service allows for the transfer of payments between banks in seconds or minutes, as opposed to some alternatives that take days. While about 1,550 U.S. financial institutions have joined the FedNow system since itlaunched in July 2023, there are thousands that have not, despite the central bank’s efforts to attract smaller banks as well. In all, there are about 9,000 U.S. financial institutions, including large banks, smaller regional and community banks, and credit unions. (Only U.S. financial institutions are allowed to connect to the FedNow system.) Nonetheless, the large banks are the most active in the payments sphere. The 50 biggest banks operating in the U.S. account for more than 90% of payment originations on the major clearing systems operated by The Clearing House andNacha, based on those organizations’ statistics. To smooth the way to joining the system, the Fed is trying to make it as easy as possible. Currently, the “record” time period for onboarding a bank — from signing a contract with the central bank to offering services — is seven days, FedNow Chief Executive Nick Stanescusaid in a video poston FedNow’s website Tuesday. He noted there are also 41 certified service providers that aid in bringing bank clients to the system. To boost transaction volume, FedNow has been gradually increasing the maximum amount that can be sent over the system. This month the Fedraised the transaction limitfrom $1 million to $10 million.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/capital-one-joins-fednow-instant-real-time-payments-bofa-truist/806138/,,
Lloyds to buy UK fintech Curve,"London-based Lloyds Bank will buy theU.K. fintech Curve, the bankannounced Wednesday. Lloyds did not disclose the price point for the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2026. But the acquisition lends credence to aSky Newsreport from last week, indicating the bank would pay £120 million for the digital wallet provider. That’s less than half the £250 million in funding Curve is said to have raised since its founding in 2015. And it’s far below the valuation CEO Shachar Bialick had targeted for the company. “In ten years’ time we are going to be IPO-ed … and hopefully worth around $50 billion to $60 billion,” Bialick, a former Israeli special forces soldier, toldThe Times of Londonin 2019, using the acronym for initial public offering. In a circular to investors last week, Curve said it “share[s] the disappointment some of you may have in this outcome.” “We recognize that the value of this transaction falls short of the ambitions we all held for Curve,” the company said in the note, seen by Sky News. “Yet, the board strongly believes this transaction represents the best available path forward for Curve's creditors and shareholders as a whole."" However, IDC Ventures, an investor that holds a 12% stake in Curve, said in a statement Friday it is ""deeply concerned about the conduct of Curve's management and board during the current sale process."" IDC alleged a small group of directors and investors at Curve “facilitated corporate decision-making to entrench control and override shareholder rights,” adding that “issues regarding [Curve’s] governance and ownership are disputed.” The investor sought toremove Curve's chairin September, but the effort failed. IDC has consistently opposed a sale to Lloyds since rumors of a potential transaction became public in July. The investor wrote “repeatedly” to Curve and its board, opposing the sale, “without receiving any meaningful response or engagement,” it asserted in September. IDC also said it wrote to Lloyds, but the bank did not respond. “It is a matter of real surprise to shareholders that Lloyds Banking Group, a leading UK institution, would contemplate proceeding with a transaction that IDC believes is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders,” IDC wrote Friday, adding it “does not believe” a sale could be “implemented” without the investor’s support. Curve’s auditors earlier this year had warned of “material uncertainty” at the firm, according toCityAM. Financial figures published in March revealed the company had paused its plans to expand to the U.S. and, in 2023, cut about a third of its workforce, according totech.eu. Curve reported a pretax loss of £36 million in 2023, up from £69 million the year before. Bialick, when asked if Curve would be profitable in 2024, said the company’s “priority is sustainable expansion, and we anticipate reaching break-even in the near term.” Curve touts a digital wallet platform that brings all of a user’s cards and alternative payment sources into one place, while offering payment flexibility, real-time spend insights and no foreign exchange fees. In a statement onCurve’s blog Wednesday, Bialick said Curve’s “mission” has always been to “simplify and supercharge people’s finances.” “Joining forces with Lloyds Banking Group means we can now scale that vision faster, helping tens of millions more customers unlock smarter payments, and empower greater financial accessibility,” he said. Curve, on its own, counts 6 million customers. Lloyds, by comparison, reaches 28 million. The bank announced in January it planned toclose 136 branchesin the U.K. as customers rely more heavily on digital banking. Buying a digital wallet platform, presumably, would dovetail with that vision. “Building on the innovative changes we’ve made to our app recently, integrating Curve’s cutting-edge technology and digital wallet capabilities will deliver a next-generation digital banking experience for our customers as we help them to take control of their finances in a simple and convenient way,” Jas Singh, CEO of consumer relationships at Lloyds, said in a release Wednesday. Lloyds said Wednesday the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the bank, or to affect full-year guidance for 2025 or 2026.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/lloyds-bank-uk-acquire-fintech-curve-digital-wallet-120-million-idc-investor-concern/806065/,,
NY AG’s office scrutinizes SoLo Funds,"Fintech lender SoLo Funds is engaged with the New York attorney general’s office related to usury concerns, an executive said this week. Denzel Singletary, head of government affairs and strategic partnerships at the company, said SoLo Funds was served a subpoena this year by state AG Letitia James’ office. “We're in negotiations with them now, figuring out … what common ground looks like,” Singletary said, speaking Monday at the Banking Transformation Summit in Charlotte, North Carolina, on the topic of fintechs and regulators working together. James’ office declined to comment Tuesday. After SoLo Funds was subpoenaed, “my job initially was to make sure New York knew that we were not working in a nefarious way,” Singletary said. He said he highlighted the fintech’s community platform and tried to dispel misconceptions customers are being charged exorbitant interest rates. SoLo Funds bills itself as a community finance platform. Its business model has drawn the attention of regulators in a handful of states who view its “tip” structure asa predatory lending practice. In recent years, SoLo hasreached agreements with regulatorsin California, Washington, D.C., Connecticut and Pennsylvania related toallegations borrowers were required to pay large “tips” to access loans through its platform. In May 2024,the Los Angeles-based fintech was suedby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau,then under the Biden administration, also took issue with SoLo’s “tip” structure, which it said obscured the total cost of loans. The CFPB also said SoLo, which marketed itself as a consumer-friendly alternative to pricier, short-term loans, hid from borrowers the option to forgo a tip, and offered loans to borrowers in states that require platforms to have a license. SoLo said it had long since changed some components of its display the CFPB called out in the lawsuit. In February, under the Trump administration, the CFPBdropped the lawsuitagainst SoLo Funds. Russ Vought, the CFPB’s acting director who also leads the OMB, said at the time that the bureau under former director Rohit Chopra “shockingly” tried to “destroy” SoLo, “which incurred millions in legal fees and had to lay off 30% of its workforce.” “It was wrong and we dismissed the case,” Vought said. Prior tojoining SoLo Funds in 2024, Singletary was the director of U.S. government affairs at investing fintech Robinhood. “When SoLo Funds reached out to me to come and work with them,” he said, “it was this opportunity of figuring out, how do I make this fintech work well with regulators? What can I do to strengthen this relationship with this particular fintech and regulators?” That task was made far more difficult when, two weeks after he joined SoLo Funds, the firm was sued by the CFPB. He called that “a very interesting intro into the company,” but said he wasn’t deterred in seeking to make sure the regulator and the fintech understood each other. Then came a “blessing” in the form of the presidential administration change in January, Singletary said. “It was an opportunity for us to state our case in front of a new body, really,” he said. In doing that, the fintech focused on its community of users. “What does this whole community look like? What is this application actually doing? Who is it actually helping?” he said. “The customers are always going to make it make sense for the regulators,” he said. “I highlighted the fact that even though there's misconceptions, that we were facing those and actually working through them.” SoLo Funds became the first company to have a lawsuit dismissed by the current CFPB, which has since dropped a number of lawsuits filed under the Biden administration. “I genuinely think that's because we highlighted the community,” Singletary said. “Bodies really matter” when it comes to cooperation between fintechs and regulators. As the CFPB has reversed course on a number of actions, James has been quick to pick up the mantle in New York. Her officesued Capital Oneover lost interest payments to consumers andsued Early Warningover alleged fraud at Zelle – and initiated both after the CFPB dropped similar lawsuits this year. James’ office has also filed lawsuits against earned wage access providersMoneyLion and DailyPay, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to thousands of workers. Travis Holoway and Rodney Williams, the founders of SoLo Funds, soughtto establish an alternative to costly payday lenders, Singletary said. They“were two college-educated men who had made it, and their friends and family were consistently asking them for loans,” Singletary said. SoLo Funds, which launched in 2018, offers checking accounts and debit cards, and through its loan marketplace, members can request loans that other users can fund. The fintech – which taps Bangor Savings Bank for banking services – has about 2 million customers and 1.8 million deposit accounts, and has facilitated about $1 billion in transactions, Singletary said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ny-ag-james-solo-funds-tips-cfpb-fintech-regulators/806024/,,
Senators back open banking rule,"Several Senate Democrats on Thursday called on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to keep pursuing open banking rules that give consumers the ability to easily shift their personal data from one financial institution to another. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut pressed CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought in a letter seen by Payments Dive to continue the federal agency’s work in writing a rule under the Dodd-Frank Act that would further such consumer rights, without fees. The agency issued such a rule last year during the Biden administration, but bank trade groups sued over the regulation and it has been tied up in court. Under Vought’s leadership, the agency stopped backing the Biden-era rule in the litigation, which a judge has stayed, pending the agency’s decision to rewrite the rule. At the same time, Vought is aggressively shrinking the agency and threatening to shutter it, leaving the rule’s future in doubt. “We are concerned that the Trump CFPB’s policymaking seems to be more driven by the seesawing interests of big banks and other industry groups than with protecting consumers’ rights to their own data, as mandated by law,” the senators wrote in their letter. The senators alsoissued a press releaseThursday, insisting Vought reinstate the priorPersonal Financial Data Rights rule. “In the absence of the rule, big banks have demonstrated that they intend to charge exorbitant fees for this data to choke off competition and concentrate this data in the hands of a few large incumbents,” the senators wrote. The senators also contended that banks should not be allowed to charge for access to the data, saying it would be a violation of the law. “Large financial institutions have a monopoly over large swaths of consumer data and thus have the potential to drive out competitors and start ups in the data sharing market,” the letter said. The senators specifically called out JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, for imposing fees this year on third-party data aggregators, including the fintech Plaid. That bank’s fees were “at rates high enough to paralyze the market,” the letter said, noting that PayPal’s peer-to-peer payment tool Venmo and neobank Chime use Plaid to connect users’ bank accounts to their apps. JPMorgan Chase was set to impose an estimated $300 million in new fees annually on Plaid, the senators said, citing an article from Forbes, before the companies reached an agreement in September on terms that weren’t disclosed. JPMorgan Chase’s initial fee structure “indicates where the market may be moving absent the CFPB’s rule,” the letter said. A second data aggregator, Yodlee, this month said it had reached anupdated agreementwith JPMorgan Chase over access fees. The senators argued that “it is critical that any revisions the CFPB makes to the Personal Financial Data Rights rule recognize the importance of consumers being able to exercise their rights, which includes deciding how and by whom their data is used.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/open-banking-cfpb-warren-wyden-blumenthal-vought-jpmorgan-plaid-chime-venmo-yodlee/806190/,,
Florida credit union to buy Georgia bank,"Jacksonville, Florida-based Community First Credit Union of Florida will buy Waycross, Georgia-based First Southern Bank, creating a $3.3 billion-asset institution, thecredit union announced Tuesday. The deal, which would extend the credit union’s footprint into southeast Georgia and elsewhere into Florida, is thesecond CU-bank tie-up announced this week,after El Paso, Texas-based GECU proposed buying Roswell, New Mexico-based Bank of the Southwest on Monday. “While we love the growth opportunities that come with the transaction, this acquisition is founded on a unified vision between Community First and First Southern Bank,” Sam Inman, CEO of Community First, said in a prepared statement. “Both institutions emphasize a community-oriented and relationship-based approach, maintaining a culture that respects individuals and prioritizes service excellence.” Both institutions are storied: Community First is 90 years old. First Southern is 118 years old. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both institutions, is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2026. After that, First Southern’s holding company will liquidate, dissolve and distribute any remaining assets to its stockholders. The new Community First will count roughly $2.5 billion in loans and $2.9 billion in deposits across 31 branches. “First Southern Bank customers will continue to see their trusted familiar banker at each location,” said First Southern CEO Daniel Hager in a prepared statement. “The newly combined institution will have the ability to offer highly personalized financial services, which will enable us the financial capabilities to support further expansion.” Community First plans to retain all First Southern employees, stretching its headcount to 530. “Combining will expand services and strengthen community impact,” Community First said in a Q&A on its website. Tie-ups between credit unions and banks are not without challengers.Independent Community Bankers of America CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey released a statement Tuesday calling for policymakers “to address the harmful impact these deals have on local communities.” CitingICBA data, Rainey said the deals harm “small businesses and local communities while community banks outperform credit unions in high-poverty areas.” She called for Congress to eliminate the federal tax exemption for credit unions with more than $1 billion in assets. More than 80% of deals since 2010 have involved credit unions of that size, ICBA found. Four in 10 deals have involved a credit union headquartered in a different state than the acquired bank. Small Business Administration lending fell almost 80% at community banks that were acquired by credit unions, according to ICBA, and the amount loaned per approved mortgage application at the institutions decreased 61%. Michael Bell, a partner at Honigman who often architects such deals – including this one – told Banking Dive that ICBA’s statements are without “substance.” “The ICBA equates size to evil for some reason,” he said. “I ask the ICBA, is a $1 billion community bank still a community bank? Should all community banks larger than $1 billion give up the many tax subsidies enjoyed by community banks?”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/florida-credit-union-buy-georgia-bank/805897/,,
White House nominates Vought aide to lead CFPB,"Additionally, Geof Gradler was named deputy director of the CFPB. He’s a former lobbyist who joined the bureau about four months ago, according tohis LinkedIn profile. The CFPB spokesperson declined to comment on the fate of the agency, or whether the bureau intended to make a similar move in another 210 days. Vought said last monthon a podcast that onlyRepublican appointees and a few career employees remain “while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months,” Vought said. Trump administration officials have tried repeatedly this yearto hobble or shutterthe agency but have, at times run into court-ordered roadblocks. The CFPB spokesperson said the hearing process likely will be a moot point for Levenbach. The Senate probably wouldn’t get around to it until next year, the spokesperson said, and with Vought not going anywhere, the formal process may not occur. Michael Emancipator, senior vice president and regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America,noted on LinkedInWednesday that Levenbach’s nomination appears to be “merely a resetting of the clock” under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. And McGuireWoods partner Jeff Ehrlich, a former deputy enforcement director at the CFPB, said the nomination is “likely a placeholder,” according toa LinkedIn post. The spokesperson pointed toa news releasethe bureau issued last week, in which the CFPB said itinformed the court inNTEU v. Voughtthat the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the CFPBcan’t legally request fundsfrom the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB “anticipates having sufficient funds to continue operations until at least December 31,” the release said.DOJ attorneys told the court that available funds are expected to run out in early 2026. Levenbach is also vice chair of theNational Capital Planning Commission, a panel that Voughtthreatened to involvein this summer’s dust-up over an over-budget renovation at the Federal Reserve. Levenbach served as chief of staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during Trump’s first term. Later, he became a senior adviser with the White House National Economic Council and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, according tohis LinkedIn profile. Prior to those roles, he spent about a decade at OMB. “Donald Trump’s sending the Senate a new nominee to lead the CFPB looks like nothing more than a front for Russ Vought to stay on as Acting Director indefinitely as he tries to illegally close down the agency,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a Wednesday statement. “Instead of doing everything in their power to lower costs for Americans, Trump and Vought want to make it easier for giant corporations to scam families out of their money.” Consumer Bankers Association CEO Lindsey Johnson said Levenbach’s nomination “comes at a critical time for consumers and the financial services marketplace.” “America’s leading Main Street banks look forward to continuing to work with the Trump Administration on data-driven, pro-growth policies that will support hardworking Americans and drive the economy forward, while at the same time ensuring the Bureau fulfills its statutory mission and sticks to what Congress authorized it to do,” she said in a Wednesday statement. “This will not only help restore the trust and credibility of the CFPB, but will benefit consumers, industry, and the broader economy alike.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-director-levenbach-vought-omb-trump/805913/,,
LevelField gets state approval to buy Chicago bank,"LevelField filed a fresh application to buy Burling inDecember 2024. In that paperwork, the Houston firm said it would pay roughly $70 million for the bank, which counts a single branch and $209.5 million in assets. The combined entity will be renamed LevelField Bank but maintain Burling’s community banking business. However, it will add a focus on deposit accounts, loans and custody services tailored to digital assets, including term loans and credit cards secured by bitcoin or Ether, according to the application. Burling's CEO, Michael Busch, will become president of LevelField Bank, Grant said. From the beginning, LevelField said it sought to become the first full-service chartered bank to offer traditional banking and digital asset services on one platform across the U.S. ""The idea is, once we have a customer, they don't have to go outside the bank perimeter for anything they want to do in digital assets,” Grant told American Banker. Grant said he expects acquisition to be finalized by the end of this year. Only Burling’s cannabis banking business will retain the Burling brand, LevelField said. To accommodate the anticipated round-the clock needs of its digital-asset user base, LevelField aims to hire roughly 100 employees in 2026 – mostly in customer service, Grant said. Once LevelField receives regulatory approval, it aims to raise $112.5 million, according to its December 2024 filing. That is meant to cover the acquisition of the bank, $20 million in growth capital and $17.5 million that LevelField will retain, the company said. In a release Monday, Grant thanked investors “for backing the patient, disciplined work it took to meet the necessary supervisory standards that protect consumers and businesses and make the U.S. the home of the world leading banking system."" As far as embracing crypto, Grant said the banking system can either ""live in denial or we can try to safely integrate it … in such a way that it works collaboratively and doesn't endanger the system."" “Financial services must be changed from the inside, and unlike other industries, outside disruptors barely move the needle,” Granttold Bloomberg.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/levelfield-acquire-burling-bank-illinois-regulator-approval-crypto-digital-asset/805947/,,
FDIC countersues Capital One over special assessment,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. accused Capital One of paying $99.4 million less than necessary to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund following the 2023 failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, according tocourt documents filed Monday. The FDIC’s lawsuit countered legal action takenin Septemberagainst the regulator by the bank, which alleged the FDICimposed an “outsized and improperly calculated” special assessment fee on Capital One. The FDIC inflated its assessment against Capital One by $149.2 million, the bank said in September. At issue is a $56 billion position between two Capital One subsidiaries which, according to Monday’s lawsuit, Capital One excluded in its reporting of uninsured deposits. Capital One said the agency “erroneously” included the position as uninsured deposits, inflating what the bank owed. The FDIC used funds from the DIF to protect uninsured depositors when banks fail. When SVB and Signature Bank were seized by the FDIC in March 2023, most of their deposits – 88% and 67%, respectively – were above the FDIC’s $250,000 threshold and “uninsured.” To recoup DIF funds later that year, the FDIC implemented a special assessment on the nation’s largest banks, including Capital One. The FDIC argued Monday that Capital One benefits from deposit insurance, and that the funds were “deposits held at the bank for which the subsidiary already received the benefit of FDIC deposit insurance.” ""There are no time machines when it comes to special assessments,” the FDIC said. Capital One and the FDIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fdic-countersues-capital-one-over-special-assessment/805937/,,
JPMorgan Chase enhancing due diligence for clients in the Amazon region,"The change itself does not come with any inherent restrictions on client activities or transactions in the region, but a JPMorgan spokesperson told ESG Dive on Wednesday that each activity and transaction will be considered “on a case-by-case basis, in line with [its] risk appetite and commercial interests.” “Managing risk is critical to the long-term success of our business,” the bank’s spokesperson said in emailed comments. “We added Amazon Biome as one example of a business location associated with clients and/or transactions we consider sensitive or in need of enhanced review, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.” The RAISG geospatial definition, which JPMorgan will use to define the biome, “is widely recommended by Indigenous leaders and activists,” according to Stand.earth. Allison Fajans-Turner, a senior campaigner at the Rainforest Action Network — one of the environmental organizations backing the annual Banking on Climate Chaos reports — said requiring enhanced due diligence for activities in the Amazon biome is “the bare minimum that we should expect from other large backers of Amazon drilling.” “JPMorgan Chase has finally taken an essential — if long-overdue — step to confront its role as the largest financier of oil and gas extraction in the Amazon,” Fajans-Turner said in Stand.earth’s Nov. 13 release. After 30% of JPMorgan’s shareholders supported a proposal to require the bank to issue a report on its practices on Indigenous People's rights in the 2024 proxy season, JPMorgan reached an agreement with shareholders proposing a similar filing in the most recent proxy season. The United Church Fundwithdrew its proposal to the bankin April — afterJPMorgan submitted a no-action requeston the filing — once the bank agreed to add a disclosure stating “the company will consider free, prior and informed consent where risks are identified before proceeding with transactions that may have material implications for Indigenous Peoples.” “Promises on paper to respect Indigenous and human rights and screen clients operating in the Amazon biome fall far short of what’s needed: real financing exclusions applied to the Amazon and other fragile ecosystems and rigorous implementation of human rights protections for Indigenous peoples and all affected local communities,” Fajans-Turner said in the Nov. 13 release. In addition to the Arctic and the Amazon, JPMorgan requires a case-by-case enhanced review for coal mining and coal-fired power activities; clients whose “main business is the physical trading of conflict minerals,” cobalt or diamond trading; and hydropower, agricultural commodities or downstream agricultural commodity use in non-designated countries.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-enhancing-due-diligence-amazon-region-clients-standearth/806007/,,
Investor blasts Comerica over Fifth Third deal,"Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management on Monday probed Comerica’s $10.9 billion deal to be acquired by Fifth Third and threatened legal action against the bank if more information on the deal process isn’t released. Additionally, Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions was Comerica’s first suitor, before the Dallas-based bank struck a deal with Fifth Third,American Bankerreported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Spokespeople for Regions and Fifth Third declined to comment. A Comerica spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July,accusing the regional lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” HoldCo, whichowns about 2.04 million shares of Comerica stock,suggested PNC, Fifth Third or Huntington as possible buyers. In October, Fifth Third said it wasacquiring Comerica for $10.9 billionin stock. Earlier this month,a regulatory filingrevealed that the Cincinnati-based lender was not Comerica’s first suitor. The CEO of another bank, identified as Financial Institution A in the filing, proposed an all-stock transaction with $78 billion-asset Comerica in September. But Comerica’s board determined the terms “were not likely to be more attractive than the consideration that could be offered by another counterparty.” HoldCo’s65-page presentation issued Monday, which parsed recent regulatory filings, alleged a lack of board oversight in Comerica CEO Curt Farmer’s interactions with Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence and the absence of a competitive process in the Fifth Third deal, saying “this isn’t negotiation; it’s surrender.” HoldCo accused Comerica’s board of ignoring Financial Institution A’s proposals, a choice it called “indefensible,” and contended “had you engaged, we believe those ‘preliminary’ bids would have matured into definitive proposals — at likely materially higher levels.” HoldCo also critiqued Farmer’s “windfall” – he’s set to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks – and the deal’s “aggressive” breakup fee of $500 million. The acquisition is set to face a shareholder vote in January. HoldCo demanded a raft of details, calling on Comerica to “provide a more complete and transparent chronology of the events leading up to the Fifth Third transaction.” That includes when the board first discussed potential responses to shareholder pressure and when it authorized Comerica management to explore a merger, as well as information on the identity of Financial Institution A, the timing, substance and financial terms of its proposals, and whether Comerica or its advisers engaged with that bank. “The apparent absence of any follow-up engagement with a bidder who made an offer — combined with the lack of evidence that J.P. Morgan sought to create competition between bidders — suggests a process engineered to favor Fifth Third rather than one designed to maximize shareholder value,” the activist investor said. HoldCo also pressed for details on the decision to hire JPMorgan Chase as Comerica’s financial adviser, and seeks more specifics related to Farmer’s conversations with Spence. “The size and timing of Mr. Farmer’s compensation package strongly indicate a potential conflict of interest — namely, that Fifth Third effectively ‘overpaid’ the CEO to secure a lower purchase price for shareholders,” the activist said. If the bank doesn’t provide the requested detail, “we will have to consider seeking expedited relief in the Delaware Court of Chancery to obtain the disclosures we believe are warranted,” HoldCo said. The activist may also consider bringing fiduciary-duty claims in the Delaware court. In recent months, Regions executives have repeatedly expressed disinterest in acquiring a bank, instead eyeing the opportunity to snag customers and talentamid disruption caused by other M&Aactivity. Regions CFO David Turner reiterated those views this month at theBancAnalysts Association of Boston conference– which would have been after the bank reportedly proposed a deal with Comerica. “We're, I think, the only bank that hadn't done an acquisition since 2006,” Turner said Nov. 7. The bank had just finished its strategic plan, “and M&A is not part of that plan,” he said. “It's just not part of where we want to focus our time and attention. And we understand things can change, but that's just not where we are today,” Turner added. Still, one analyst noted some wonder whether the bank’s position may change. “With increased M&A activity in their Southeast backyard, there have been investors who wonder if [Regions management] would start to feel compelled to take part in the M&A wave, particularly since the company is profitable but has had challenges growing organically,” Truist Securities analyst Brian Finneran wrote in a Tuesday note.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/holdco-activist-comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-regions/805807/,,
Revolut valued at $75B,"Revolut is valued at $75 billion after completing a share sale, theBritish fintech said Monday. Revolut did not disclose how many shares were sold or the amount raised. It’s the fifth share sale Revolut has allowed its staff to date, with the fintech asserting it’s “one of the most liquid employee share programmes across private companies in the industry.” The new valuation marks significant growth sinceRevolut’s $45 billion valuation 15 months ago, which came directly after it received its long-awaitedBritish banking license. Since then, Revolut has entered multiple markets,named a chairof its Western Europe arm and finalized itsbanking license in Mexico. It’s also exploring U.S. growth, with Revolut U.S. CEO Sid Jajodia saying in October thatnabbing a stateside charteris part of the firm’s growth “mission.” “The level of investor interest and our new valuation reflect the strength of our business model, which is delivering both rapid growth and strong profitability,” CFO Victor Stinga said in a prepared statement on the recent share sale. “We welcome onboard a series of world-class investors and look forward to working with them for the next stage in Revolut’s evolution.” The transaction was led by Coatue, Greenoaks, Dragoneer and Fidelity Management & Research Company. Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Andreessen Horowitz, Franklin Templeton and T. Rowe Price Associates also participated. In ablog postMonday, Coatue wrote that it sees Revolut “charting a new path.” “They are building the world’s first global financial super-app, which is now operating in 39 countries and serves over 65 million users,” wrote Brendan O’Boyle, Rohan Bharvani and Lucas Swisher, investors at Coatue, which also led Revolut’s 2024 funding round. “What began as a travel card designed to avoid high [foreign exchange] fees has evolved into a multi-product financial platform that is redefining what modern banking looks like for consumers and businesses.” Revolut’s 2024 revenue grew 72% to $4 billion year over year, with profit before tax more than doubling to $1.4 billion. Its Revolut Business arm hit $1 billion in annualized revenue in 2025, the company said. The new valuation “reflects the remarkable progress we have made in the last twelve months towards our vision of building the first truly global bank, serving 100 million customers across 100 countries,” CEO Nik Storonsky said in a prepared statement. A spokesperson for Revolut had no further comment beyond the press release.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/revolut-valued-75-billion/806502/,,
"Comerica, Fifth Third sued by activist investor","Just days after threatening legal action against Comerica, HoldCo Asset Management has sued the regional bank and its proposed buyer, Fifth Third. The activist investor accused Comerica CEO Curt Farmer of being “focused solely on advancing his own interests” based on the “rushed” way the Dallas-based bank’s proposed$10.9 billion acquisition by Fifth Thirdcame together. Theclass-action complaint, filed Friday in the Delaware Court of Chancery by HoldCo Opportunities Fund, alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by Comerica and its board members related to the transaction and its “draconian” provisions. It also accuses the bank of leaving out material information from disclosures related to the deal. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCo also accused Fifth Third of “aiding-and-abetting” the board in breaching its fiduciary duty. HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July, accusing the lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” In October, Fifth Third announced it would acquire Comerica. HoldCoissued a presentationlast week that picked apart the proposed deal, threatening to take Comerica to court if it didn’t release more information on how the agreement came together. Comerica rebuffed at leastone earlier suitor, Financial Institution A, according to a disclosure. That was Regions Bank, American Banker reported. The deal between Comerica and Fifth Third was “negotiated over an extraordinarily compressed timeline,” HoldCo’s Friday complaint contends. It was driven by Farmer’s “fear of an activist contest” led by HoldCo, “and his fear that no other bidder would keep him on,” the firm alleged. “Fearing for his job, Farmer raced to find a friendly white knight that could provide him with a lucrative post-closing role,” the complaint asserts. Farmer isset to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks. Part of the rush, HoldCo claims, was to avoid any proxy contest at Comerica’s annual meeting, to have been held by May 2026. The Fifth Third deal is projected to close in the first quarter of 2026. Although Comerica received an offer from Financial Institution A, the complaint alleges the Dallas bank decided to “nip those negotiations in the bud” and solely focus on Fifth Third. The deal came together hastily and in a way that ensures “no topping bid could disrupt Farmer’s entrenchment plan,” HoldCo attorneys alleged. The merger agreement carries a “gargantuan” termination fee of $500 million and “an absurdly narrow fiduciary-out” that doesn’t let the board scrap the merger for a higher bid, HoldCo said in the complaint. The “draconian” deal protections mean Comerica’s board couldn’t terminate the acquisition for a better proposal until October 2026, even if shareholders don’t vote in favor of the deal, the filing said. HoldCo also alleges the registration statement is “materially misleading and incomplete” and doesn’t provide shareholders with any details that would allow them to compare the deal’s terms with Financial Institution A’s proposed offers. “There is no evidence from the Registration Statement that Comerica ever made a counterproposal or tried to negotiate for a price above the lowest end of the exchange ratio range in Fifth Third’s initial proposal,” the complaint said. “Nor is there any evidence that Comerica made any attempt to re-engage Financial Institution A (to see if it would provide a better proposal) or solicit interest from other potential bidders.” The 17-day span – from the start of potential merger conversations between Farmer and Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence to when an agreement was signed – “is the shortest timeframe of any of the ten largest bank mergers, with the next shortest taking 43 days and the median taking 67 days,” HoldCo contended. “Such negotiations are more reminiscent of distressed bank sales during the 2008 global financial crisis,” the complaint said. In aresponse filed Monday, attorneys for Comerica argued HoldCo’s views are at odds with those of other bank shareholders, and blasted the activist for “asking this Court to deprive stockholders of a merger after agitating for just such a deal.” Fifth Third’s attorneys, in aseparate Monday filing, called HoldCo’s aiding and abetting assertion a “facially meritless claim.” “This case is only about HoldCo’s self-serving activism goals,” Fifth Third’s attorneys said. Comerica and Fifth Third attorneys accused HoldCo of “gamesmanship” and called its claims weak. Comerica’s lawyers also needled HoldCo for “revel[ing] in its notoriety” after pushing for the bank to sell itself and seeking credit for the outcome. Comerica’s attorneys also noted HoldCo was in communication with the bank’s counsel in the days leading up to filing Friday’s complaint. “At no time during those communications did HoldCo indicate it would be filing a suit to enjoin the deal on Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week,” Comerica’s attorneys said. The shareholder vote on the acquisition is tentatively scheduled for Jan. 6. A hearing was set to be held Tuesday related to a motion to expedite the case. Spokespeople for Comerica and Fifth Third declined to comment. Attorneys withBernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman, the law firm representing HoldCo, didn’t return requests for comment. HoldCo also didn’t respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-sued-activist-investor-holdco/806428/,,
Fulton Financial to buy NJ’s Blue Foundry in $243M deal,"Fulton Financial Corp.will acquire Blue Foundry Bancorpin an all-stock transaction valued at $243 million, the companies announced Monday. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, pushes Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based Fulton into northern New Jersey. The bank gained a presence in the southern part of the state last year with itsacquisition of Republic First. The Philadelphia-based bank had locations in New Jersey and New York before it failed. Acquiring $2.15 billion-asset Blue Foundry, headquartered in Rutherford, New Jersey, gives $32 billion-asset Fulton 21 additional branches in eight counties, including four of the state’s most populous. “The expansion in northern New Jersey aligns with our strategy of growing in our local markets and positions us well to drive organic growth across our commercial, consumer, wealth advisory and mortgage businesses,” Fulton CEO Curtis Myers said in a prepared statement. “The combination of our companies creates an opportunity to leverage Fulton’s robust banking services and provide greater convenience and innovative solutions to an expanded customer base, with a continued focus on supporting our local communities,” he said. Under the terms of the agreement, Blue Foundry investors will receive 0.65 shares of Fulton common stock for each share they own. The transaction’s estimated $243 million value stems from Fulton’s $17.96 share price from Friday. “Joining forces with Fulton is an exciting step forward for our employees, customers and communities,” Blue Foundry CEO James Nesci said in a prepared statement. “This partnership allows us to preserve the local relationships and personalized service our customers value, while gaining access to greater resources and providing more solutions and convenience to customers.” In recent years, Blue Foundry has been a publicly traded bank, during which time it has reported more than $20 million in losses,American Bankerreported. Activist investor Larry Seidman, who had pushed for its sale via proxy campaign last year, told American Banker there was “no question whatsoever” that Fulton would be able to produce better results than Blue Foundry has with its assets. “It's a good bank with good management,” Seidman said of Fulton. “Blue Foundry was horrible. They couldn't make any money.” The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to tangible book value per share. It’s expected to be accretive to first full-year earnings by over 5%, and neutral to regulatory capital ratios at close. As part of the deal, Fulton will make a $1.5 million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation, which provides impact grants to nonprofit community organizations in New Jersey.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fulton-financial-to-buy-nj-blue-foundry-243m-deal/806443/,,
MoneyLion to pay $1.75M to settle CFPB lawsuit,"MoneyLion agreed Friday topay $1.75 millionto settle a long-running lawsuit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, alleging the fintech charged more than the maximum 36% interest rate allowed by the Military Lending Act on loans to service members. The settlement narrows – to 12 – the number of cases the CFPB has in active litigation, based on acount given last weekby a representative of the bureau’s workers union. The CFPB has dismissed 22 enforcement actions this year. The case also bolsters the CFPB’s commitment –from April, and subsequently reinforced in a “humility pledge” Friday – to focus on providing redress to service members, veterans and their families. As part of the settlement, MoneyLion is barred from extending consumer credit at rates higher than 36% to borrowers for whom the MLA cap applies. That includes credit insurance premiums or fees, any fee for a debt cancellation contract or debt suspension agreement, or any fee for a credit-related ancillary product sold as part of a credit transaction. It also includes finance charges, application fees or membership fees. That was a focal point of the CFPB’sSeptember 2022 lawsuitagainst the company. MoneyLion required customers to join a membership program – which carried a monthly fee between $19.99 and $29 – to access the fintech’s low annual percentage rate installment loan product, the bureau said when the suit was first filed. But the company failed to allow borrowers to cancel their memberships until their loans were paid, and in some cases, wouldn’t cancel memberships if the borrower had unpaid membership fees, the CFPB added. Friday’s settlement bars MoneyLion from preventing borrowers from canceling their membership. It also does not permit the fintech to engage in collections activities for past unpaid membership fees, collecting membership fees for periods when memberships were suspended. MoneyLion also can’t prevent borrowers from paying off loans in full by using funds in their credit reserve account, according to the settlement. Nor can the company ding borrowers’ credit scores over unpaid membership fees. Also as part of the settlement, MoneyLion must submit an accurate written compliance report, sworn under penalty of perjury, to the CFPB, detailing the number of borrowers who received redress and the amount paid to each. The settlement covers borrowers who had outstanding MoneyLion loans between December 2017 and October 2024. MoneyLion, in September 2022, disputed the CFPB’s allegations, accusing the regulator of taking a “sensationalist route of prioritizing headlines instead of engaging in constructive dialogue.” “MoneyLion has the highest regard for its military and veteran customers and [is] committed to working with this important community to help them achieve better financial health,” the company said at the time. “MoneyLion is honored to serve this important segment of its customer base and is grateful for the sacrifice these men and women have made for our country.” The membership offering represents a small subset of MoneyLion’s business, the company said at the time. Since then, the fintech has come under new management: MoneyLionwas acquired this yearby Gen Digital forabout $1 billion. The CFPB is also not the only entity with a consumer-protection case against MoneyLion.New York’s attorney generalsued MoneyLion and fellow earned wage access provider DailyPay in April, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to tens of thousands of workers with fees that “amount to outrageous annual interest rates in the triple digits.” Thecity of Baltimorelast month sued MoneyLion, alleging the company misled and manipulated consumers into taking out small-dollar, short-term loans that come with high fees. MoneyLion in 2023 persuaded the judge in the CFPB case topause proceedingsahead of aSupreme Court rulingthat affirmed the bureau’s funding structure is constitutional.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-moneylion-settlement-mla-interest-rate-36-cap-military-membership-fees/806439/,,
U.S. Bank hires up for greater Southeast growth,"After adding bankers to serve businesses in Dallas and Houston, U.S. Bank is now focused on further expansion across the Southeast, a business banking executive said. Within the next six months, U.S. Bank plans to hire at least a dozen bankers in a couple of Southeast states where it doesn’t have branches, said Dee O’Dell, head of business banking sales at the Minneapolis-based lender. He didn’t elaborate, butthat group includesAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. The super-regional bank has recently added teams of bankers in markets where it’s seeing greater growth opportunity, including a second team in Charlotte, North Carolina; a second in Las Vegas; and a fourth in Chicago, O’Dell said during a recent interview. In his unit, about 250 people have been hired into new roles this year. In Houston, where the $695 billion-asset bank announced last week it added a business banking team, four people have been hired and the lender plans to bring on two more, he said. In U.S. Bank’s business banking segment, which serves companies generating between $2.5 million to $50 million in annual revenue, about 1,200 employees across the country serve about 75,000 clients, O’Dell said. The consumer and business banking segmentmakes up about 32%of the lender’s overall revenue, which was $21.3 billion year to date,as of Sept. 30. U.S. Bank provides those commercial clients with different types of credit for their capital needs, including conventional financing, owner-occupied real estate loans and Small Business Administration loans. Clients in that size range often “not only have their primary business, but they're looking for ways to diversify,” O’Dell said. “They not only want to own the building they're in, they may want to own some other buildings as well, and so we've got the ability to provide capital for them, not only for their core business, but for investment real estate.” Bankers also seek to connect clients with other U.S. Bank services, such as credit cards, merchant processing, treasury management, foreign exchange and wealth management. Amid a highly competitive landscape, the lender has sharpened efforts to offer anddeliver services to clientsin a comprehensive way, O’Dell said. “Our approach has been to integrate all that together so that there is value that comes from having all of that in one place,” he said. To zero in on where businesses could gain the most benefit, the bank developed – along with a fintech O’Dell wouldn’t name – a proprietary diagnostic tool for companies. The questionnaire assesses business needs and money movement, diagnoses the level of efficiency in those functions and has a team review results with business clients. “The idea is that instead of trying to sell any one of those products, we're approaching it in a much more consultative and holistic way,” O’Dell said. “It helps our clients see how they can be even more efficient, save time in their day, eliminate risk of fraud, other things like that.” That diagnostic effort has bolstered the bank’s success rate in serving new clients since it was introduced nearly two years ago, O’Dell said. “Sometimes our bankers will meet with a company that we don't bank with today. And if your question is, ‘Do you need any banking services?’ The answer might be, ‘No, no, everything's fine. It's all good,’” O’Dell said. “If we can get them to engage with us and have this conversation and fill out this basic template questionnaire, we can go back and provide insights. And often, it opens up a conversation where companies don't even realize the things that they are doing or not doing that could lead to so much greater efficiency.” Another newer internal tool aggregates data to give bankers a view of companies or prospects within the markets they serve, allowing them to sort by sales size, industry type or ownership of property, so they can better target clients based on potential needs, O’Dell said. SBA loans may be a prime option for some of those businesses and that’s an area of lending U.S. Bank seeks to grow further, since it can serve as a company’s entry point into the bank. U.S. Bank has doubled its SBA lending in the past two years, O’Dell said. In fiscal 2025, the bank totaled $871.2 million in SBA 7(a) loans, up 23% from the previous fiscal year,it said last month. “We've been able to use that program to help a number of companies, individuals get capital they wouldn't otherwise be able to get, and because of the way that we approach that, and our client selection in that, the loss ratio that we've had in that space has been very attractive to our shareholders,” O’Dell said. SBA lending can be ideal in some succession situations, O’Dell noted. The segment of businesses O’Dell oversees has a significant number of owners nearing the end of their careers, so the bank also aims to jump on the chance to be involved in those moments. In cases where a business owner doesn’t have a child who wants to take over, they may look to sell to a similar company or private equity firm. Or if there’s someone in the company who’s interested in acquiring it but doesn’t have the capital, the bank can use an SBA loan to help with that pursuit. “We see great opportunities to help the next generation of business owners acquire business and a current generation who are at the end of their careers, exit, monetize what they've invested in, and have this sense that their legacy will continue,” O’Dell said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/us-bank-adding-business-bankers-southeast-odell/806212/,,
VALT Bank applies for de novo charter,"A group of former U.S. Bank executives is seeking federal approval to establish VALT Bank, applications submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Nov. 13 show. The proposed bank, headquartered in Eagle, Idaho, will be fully digital and will focus on serving “digitally demanding small to midsized businesses” in the U.S., according to its application. VALT plans to offer credit and deposit products as well as treasury and cash management services, and plans to provide clients with SMB-focused automation solutions. The bank will be led by proposed director, CEO and President Matt Gediman, whose nearly two-decade U.S. Bank career culminated in three years as a managing director in the bank’s private wealth management business. “When we refer to ‘digitally demanding SMBs,’ we mean revenue-generating small and midsized businesses that use technology across their daily operations and expect the same level of technological fluency from their financial service providers,” Gediman told Banking Dive via email Monday. These are traditional businesses, he added – not tech firms or crypto companies. VALT does not plan to interact with digital assets. “Our customers are established SMBs that simply expect modern, reliable, integrated digital banking,” he said. “[O]ur model is designed to support them by making banking uncomplicated, accessible, and integrated with digital tools to run their businesses more efficiently,” he said. Former U.S. Bank Vice Chairman John Elmore is VALT’s proposed executive chair and Ross Carey, former U.S. Bank EVP of business banking and SBA division, is its proposed vice chair. Kim Hoyt, attorney at Salem, Oregon-based law firm Garrett Hemann Robertson, and Dana Johnson, president and chief investment officer at single-family office MidAmerica Capital Partners, are VALT’s additional proposed directors. The OCC declined to comment on the application, and the FDIC did not respond immediately to a request for comment. But the heads of both agencies have recently spoken in favor of increased de novo chartering. Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gouldtold Banking Dive last monththat one of his major goals while at the helm of the OCC is “invigorating de novo chartering in America.” Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hillnoted earlier this year that new bank formationhas “fallen off a cliff” in recent years. At the American Bankers Association’s Washington Summit in April, he noted that 412 new banks were formed in 1984 alone, and that the lowest number of new banks established in any year between 1995 and 2007 was 93. By comparison, just 86 new banks have been formed since 2010, Hill said, and more than half of them came between 2019 and 2022 when Trump appointee Jelena McWilliams ran the FDIC. The OCC and the FDIC have received a number of bank applications since President Donald Trump took office again in January. Applicants includingCoinbaseandStripe-owned Bridgeseek national trust charters, which do not allow for lending or taking insured deposits. One bank – Erebor Bank, which applied for a de novo charter in June – has received conditional approval under Gould’s leadership. Its conditional approval wasgranted in October. TheOCC leasing manualindicates that the agency should make decisions on a charter application within 120 days of receiving it, lining VALT up for an answer by mid-March. Gediman, for VALT’s part, said the team’s intention is to “build a safe, well-governed institution that meets the needs of modern business owners through a unique digital-first experience.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/valt-bank-applies-for-de-novo-charter/806295/,,
CFPB can’t ignore judge’s order: workers union,"Lawyers for a workers unionurged a federal courtSunday to clarify apreliminary injunctionto ensure that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau leaders don’t shutter the agency by refusing funding. “The defendants have filed a ‘notice’ announcing that they intend to allow the Bureau to run out of funding, and when it does, they will stop complying with the Court’s injunction,” attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union wrote Sunday. “Parties may not simply declare that an injunction no longer applies.” The CFPB this monthalertedthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it “anticipates exhausting its currently available funds in early 2026.” At issue is the definition of “combined earnings.” The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel sent a memo to CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought on Nov. 7, asserting that it interprets earnings – from which the Federal Reserve derives the CFPB’s operating budget – as profit rather than revenue. By that math, the Fed has operated at a loss since 2022. NTEU attorneys asserted Sunday that the Fed earns “billions of dollars a year – from interest on loans and securities, and fees assessed” on banks. But because the Fed has raised interest rates since 2022, its combined interest expenses have exceeded combined earnings. The plaintiffs cite congressional testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told lawmakers the central bank examined that balance “very carefully” and concluded the law is “very clear” that the Fed must fund the CFPB even when its expenses exceed its earnings. Further, NTEU attorneys said, the OLC memo “admits, nobody – not any court, not the Fed, and not the CFPB – has ever interpreted” combined earnings as it suggested this month. “Both the Fed and the CFPB (until Vought needed a mechanism to circumvent this Court’s injunction) have consistently understood ‘combined earnings’ to mean, simply, everything the Fed earns,” NTEU attorneys wrote. The OLC’s interpretation relies on “technical definitions from corporate accounting,” NTEU attorneys wrote. “But the Fed is not a private corporation. It sets monetary policy for the United States. … The only reason to adopt its reading of ‘combined earnings’ is to shut down the CFPB.” Vought, in an appearance last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” indeed said of the CFPB: “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within thenext two, three months.” The bureau last week indicated it istransferring all of its active litigationto the DOJ. By the OLC’s logic, NTEU attorneys wrote, Congress would have passed a Dodd-Frank Act “that forces the Federal Reserve Board to choose between increasing interest rates to combat inflation and funding the CFPB.” “Fortunately, that is not the law that Congress wrote,” the attorneys asserted, blasting the CFPB for not choosing another path. “Rather than asking this Court to modify its injunction (which would require them to demonstrate that it should), the defendants have chosen to just ‘inform’ the Court that they ‘do not understand’ the injunction to bind them once the CFPB runs out of money – even if that’s because they decided not to ask the Fed for funding,” NTEU attorneys wrote. Outside of the courtroom, the CFPB on Friday issued what it termed a “humility pledge” meant to be read aloud by bank examiners to banks before exams. The statement drills down on the bureau’snarrowing of focustoward consumer threats that harm service members, veterans and their families and reiterates that the bureau will “avoid, where possible, duplication of supervision, where States or other regulators are already doing that job.” The bureau pledges shorter examination times – reduced from eight weeks to a period “commensurate with the defined scope of exams.” “No longer will the Bureau ask for expansive data sets or other information which may seem unrelated to the exam or include information inconsistent with Bureau priorities,” the pledge reads. “Any follow-up requests by examiners will first be discussed with an entity and will be tailored to the scope of the exam and the information already received from the entity.” The CFPB states its goal as “[to] work collaboratively with the entities to review entities’ processes for compliance and/or remedy existing problems,” emphasizing self-reporting and encouraging banks to resolve issues with the CFPB’s supervision unit, rather than enforcement. That may lend credence to a narrative, from an all-hands meeting of enforcement staff, in which the bureau’s acting enforcement chief said all 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation at the end of the year. Curiously, perhaps, the pledge encourages banks, if they find their exam experience to be “inconsistent with these principles,” to reach out via email to a designated CFPB supervisory official or the bureau’s chief legal officer. In apost Monday on the NTEU’s website, union member Alexis Goldstein asked, “Why is Russell Vought showing the world his weird, creepy pledge of allegiance to big corporations?” Another union member, Doug Wilson, notes a passage in the pledge in which the bureau asserts that examiners will be “encouraged and incentivized to complete the work promptly and under budget.” “This memo doesn't add up,” Wilson wrote. “Vought’s stopped all supervision exams in 2025, refuses to fund CFPB and says he’s shutting us down by 2026. So how will we supervise banks in 2026 if CFPB is closed? How can bank exams be ‘under budget’ if there is no budget?” In an emailed press release to accompany the humility pledge, the CFPB characterized the bureau’s Biden-era supervision efforts as “thuggery,” calling out ex-supervision chief LoreleiSalas as “a former [Democratic donor George] Soros activist who wasput on leave in February 2025.” Further, bureau leadership labeled the pre-Trump supervision unit as “a weaponized arm of the CFPB.” In aLinkedIn post, Allison Preiss, who until February served as senior adviser to the CFPB director, said the humility pledge “might be better characterized as a humiliation pledge.” “The notion that federal employees should genuflect, trembling, before a Wells Fargo or Bank of America, is some of the most ridiculous nonsense I've read all week,” she wrote. In anotherLinkedIn post, Tyler Creighton, counsel at the CFPB, took issue with the idea that the bureau is calling out examiners’ past conduct. “Supervision's workers have always conducted examinations professionally, efficiently, conscientiously, and with a focus on remedying consumer harm,” he wrote. “We will continue to do so, just as soon as Donald Trump and Russell Vought end the nearly 10-month suspension of examinations and let us get back to work for the American people.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-humility-pledge-supervision-enforcement-bank-examiners-fed-funding-refuse-vought-court/806314/,,
Stripe faces bank charter pushback,"A national trust banking charter would let the digital payments giant Stripe offer banking services while sidestepping certain regulations, an advocacy organization opposingthe payment provider's charter applicationargued in a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency this month. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition alsosaid in the letterthat the charter would give Stripe legitimacy that it does not deserve, pointing to the fintech’s history of legal trouble. Stripe, whichacquired a stablecoin infrastructure companycalled Bridge this year, proposes to name the bank Bridge National Trust. “The OCC must reject Stripe’s application for a national trust bank charter due to serious concerns regarding Stripe’s disregard for enforcement, governance, compliance, and consumer protection laws,” according to the Nov. 13 letter, which is addressed to Sebastian Astrada, the agency’s director for licensing of novel banks. The NCRC is a coalition of hundreds of U.S. community-based organizations which run the gamut from faith-based nonprofits to social justice advocates. The organization posted the letter on its website last week. Bridgeapplied for the charter in October. The charter would give Bridge and its parent company the right to provide custody, stablecoin issuance, and management of stablecoin reserves within a federal framework, rather than through state-to-state money transmitter licenses. Spokespeople for Stripe did not respond to messages seeking comment about the NCRC’s letter. If the charter is approved, Bridge would form the Bridge National Trust Bank, to be headquartered in New York City, according tothe Oct. 14 application. CEO Patrick Collison co-founded Stripe along with his brother John Collison, who is president of the business. “We’ve long believed stablecoins will be a core, regulated building block,” Bridge co-founder Zach Abrams wroteon the social media platform Xlast month. “This regulatory infrastructure will enable us to tokenize trillions of dollars and make this future possible.” The crypto firmsCircle,Paxos,RippleandCoinbasehave also applied for charters through the OCC, although none of those applications has been approved yet. With the trust, Stripe could also facilitate payments without supervision from the Federal Reserve, the NCRC said in its letter. “Granting these firms limited purpose trust charters would blur the statutory boundaries of what constitutes a bank, undermine the credibility of the national charter, and heighten systemic risk by allowing them to operate under a lighter regulatory regime,” the group wrote. The coalition also outlines some of the lawsuits and legal action taken against Stripe. In 2020, for example, the Massachusetts attorney general found Stripe had facilitated payments for a fraudulent cryptocurrency operation due to subpar risk monitoring and fraud prevention systems. The companyagreed to pay $120,000and improve its fraud control and employee training. The letter also lists several lawsuits against the company alleging, among other things, that Stripe failed to ensure customer privacy and protect customer data.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/stripe-faces-bank-charter-pushback/806315/,,
How the open banking rule skidded,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said this month it cannot draw funding to continue operations when its current funds lapse, presenting the agency a number of challenges in formulating an open banking rule quickly. The CFPBtold a federal courtNov. 11 that the Justice Department had concluded that the bureau cannot “lawfully draw funds” from the Federal Reserve System – which Congress designated as its funding source – and that the agency has funds to operate until year’s end. The bureau’s notice did not specify what would happen then, although the CFPB’s acting director, Russ Vought, has assailed the agency in the past and spoke publicly in October about itsclosure within months. The bureau has been working on a new open banking rule since July, when it told a federal court it would “substantially”revise the ruleand was granted a litigation stay of a lawsuitfiled last yearby banking trade groups. The CFPB did not respond to an email Monday seeking comment on the rule. Last week, the bureau notified employees that it wouldtransfer its litigation workto the DOJ and planned additional furloughs at year’s end. In its motion for a stay, the bureau told U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves it planned “an accelerated rulemaking process” to address what it considered to be deficiencies with the prior rule, enacted under the Biden administration. But any proposed rule with significant changes – such as allowing financial institutions to charge fees for access to customers’ data – would also require the bureau to assess the impacts to small businesses under the federal Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, attorneys noted. At that point, a public comment period on the proposed rule – typically 30 to 90 days – would begin. The CFPB would then consider those comments and issue a final rule. However, the bureau is considering skipping some parts of the rulemaking process to issue a rule by year’s end, potentially including a public comment period on its proposed rule,Bloomberg Law reportedThursday, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. “Given the polarized view of these rules by the banking and FinTech sectors, if either constituency objects to the substance of the CFPB’s revisions, additional litigation could ensue,” an attorney with law firm McGlinchey Stafford, Adam Maarec, wrote in a Septemberalertabout the process. “An ‘accelerated rulemaking’ still takes a long time,” added Maarec, who advises fintechs and banks. The prior rule took CFPB staff four years from the rulemaking notice to a final rule, he noted, adding “the scope of issues here seems significantly narrower.” Banking groups that sued the bureau last year leaned heavily on the Administrative Procedure Act for their complaint, arguing that the agency had overstepped its authority to impose “a complicated, costly, and fundamentally insecure mandatory data-sharing framework” that did not allow banks to recover their costs. Last month, Reeves issued apreliminary injunctionpreventing the bureau from enforcing its rule, pending the revised rule the CFPB is formulating. A spokesperson for the Bank Policy Institute said Monday the organization understands that the bureau’s rulemaking process is moving forward but declined to comment further, directing other queries to the agency. The Financial Data and Technology Association, which counts data aggregators Plaid and Yodlee as members, said it continues to oppose any effort allowing banks to impose fees for customer data. Both Plaid and Yodlee have announced agreements with the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase, in the past two months that include new fees for data access. The Dodd-Frank Act does not permit fees, which are “a competitive toll on consumers simply for exercising their right to access and share their own financial information,” FDATA Executive Director Steve Boms said Monday in an emailed statement. “If banks are given the green light to impose those fees in a new rule, it would fundamentally shift control of financial data away from consumers and toward already powerful incumbents.” A spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association declined to comment Friday on the CFPB’s future or rule process, as did the American Fintech Council on Monday. Vought, who also leads the Office of Management and Budget, has been trying todramatically downsizethe CFPB’s workforce and mission since he was appointed acting director in February. “We don’t have anyone working there except our Republican appointees and a few career [employees] that are doing statutory responsibilities while weclose down the agency,” Vought said last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months.” Conservative lawmakers and interest groups have targeted the bureau since Congress formed it 15 years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. “The CFPB is a highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency. It is unconstitutional,” the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote in its “Project 2025Mandate for Leadership” document, in a chapter written by Robert Bowes, ahousing department officialin the first Trump administration and a former Chase Manhattan banking executive. “The next conservative President should order the immediate dissolution of the agency — pull down its prior rules, regulations and guidance, return its staff to their prior agencies and its building to the General Services Administration.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-open-banking-rule-skidded-fintechs-banks-vought-court/806436/,,
Ex-Truist employee sentenced in ‘complex’ check-cashing scheme,"A former Truist branch employee is one of eight Georgia residents sentenced in a counterfeit check-cashing scheme that involved stolen check information, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgiasaid Wednesday. The “complex” check-cashing and kickback scheme ran from at least November 2021 to December 2022, prosecutors said. At the time, Mariarlene Brown, aka “Mati Mom,” 44, of Valdosta, worked at a Truist branch in that city. In conspiring with Brown and others to commit bank fraud, William Allen Roberts, 27, of Valdosta, unlawfully obtained check information from Vincent Galliard, 41, of Sumter, South Carolina. Galliard was a former U.S. Postal Service employee in South Carolina who sold checks he stole from the mail, prosecutors said. Roberts used the check information provided by Galliard to produce fraudulent checks. Six others involved in the scheme recruited people to open Truist bank accounts and then got those people to provide their new Truist debit card and account information to those behind the scheme, “with the understanding that they would be paid for doing so,” prosecutors said. That group of co-conspirators included Frederick Pernell Green, 27; Thomas Christopher Mitchell, 31; Calvin Dewayne McKeithen, aka “Supa,” 26; Dewayne Rasheen Butler, aka “Guwapo,” 26; Tyler Khershad Jones, aka “LA Clippers,” 24; and Davontay Wiseman, aka “Vonn,” 28. Those six then passed the account information on to Roberts, who would write checks to those individuals in various amounts. Roberts, with Brown’s help, deposited checks into those accounts, and Brown made sure Roberts could withdraw cash from the accounts, according to prosecutors. Roberts paid Brown for her help in the scheme, as well as the co-conspirators and account holders, prosecutors said. Green, Roberts, Mitchell, McKeithen, Jones, Butler and Wiseman kept most of each check that was deposited, prosecutors said. Text messages the group members exchanged described the conspiracy, and investigators also discovered photos of debit cards, account numbers, fraudulent checks, cash obtained from the check deposits “and a custom-made diamond ring in the shape of the Truist logo worn by Green,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Brown was sentenced to 33 months in prison, five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $390,475.84 in restitution to Truist on Oct. 9, after she pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Seven others – all except Galliard – also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, were sentenced to prison time and ordered to pay Truist restitution in the same amount. Galliard pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a South Carolina case and was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison, along with five years of supervised release, prosecutors said. Galliard was ordered to pay $149,692.14 in restitution divided among The Citizens Bank, First Citizens Bank, South Atlantic Bank, TD Bank, The Conway National Bank and Bank of America, according toa court filing. “Individuals who participate in check-cashing and kickback schemes will face imprisonment and other penalties,” U.S. Attorney Will Keyes said in the press release. “Investigators from the Secret Service and the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office worked to unravel this criminal network, ultimately preventing further theft and helping us ensure accountability for the defendants.” Bank regulators seek to bolster their efforts to address check fraud, which has grown “substantially” in the past several years, Michelle Bowman, the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision,said in June. Although check use has dropped, check fraud hasn’t diminished in tandem. “Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of real or attempted check fraud transactions grew nearly fourfold, even as the number of checks paid fell by more than 18 percent from 2018 to 2021,”the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantareported this year.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ex-truist-employee-sentenced-check-cashing-scheme/806169/,,
Citi CFO Mark Mason to step down in March,"Citi CFO Mark Mason, arguably the highest-profile Black executive at a U.S.-based global systemically important financial institution, will step down from his role in early March, the bankannounced Thursday. At that point, Gonzalo Luchetti, now the bank’s head of U.S. personal banking, will become CFO. Mason, meanwhile, will transition to executive vice chair and senior executive adviser to Citi CEO Jane Fraser, but he intends to pursue leadership opportunities outside the bank by the end of 2026, according to the announcement. In his adviser role, Mason will help Citi prepare for its investor day May 7 and give guidance on the bank’s strategic initiatives. Mason has been a key figure in Citi’stwo-year reorganization, in which the bank set out to simplify its structure,trim its headcount by 20,000employees by 2026, and embrace tech modernization meant to free it fromtwo 2020 consent orders. Citi launched further reorganization Thursday, saying it would integrate its retail bank into its wealth business. The move arguably hands more responsibility to wealth chief Andy Sieg. The bank’s U.S. Everyday Banking, Citi Priority, Citigold and Citigold Private Client labels will be consolidated into a single group led by Kate Luft. Luft, who has served as head of U.S. retail bankingsince April, will add “and Citigold” to her title and report to Sieg. With the move, “U.S. Personal Banking” will no longer be one of Citi’s five core businesses, the company said. But it will be replaced by “U.S. Consumer Cards,” which will combine the bank’s branded cards and retail services businesses under Pam Habner. Habner, who has served as Citi’s head of branded cards and lendingsince 2020, will join the bank’s executive management team and report directly to Fraser. “This evolution of our leadership team and structure is well timed as it puts in place our next generation of leaders ahead of our upcoming Investor Day, when we will lay out our plans to further grow our returns,” Fraser said Thursday in a statement. “We are ending the year with momentum and confidence.” Mason’s upcoming transition comes less than a month after Citi threw added support behind Fraser,naming her chairand giving her a $25 million equity award meant to keep her in place for years to come. Fraser on Thursday called Mason “an invaluable partner” who “models integrity, drive and commitment no matter the circumstances, and has always put the firm first.” “Mark has proven himself to be a leader for all seasons, having helped Citi navigate some of our most challenging times and being a driving force behind the results we are now seeing in our performance and our Transformation,” Fraser said, citing the capitalized term the bank gives its tech modernization. Mason joined Citi in 2001 and has been CFO since 2019 – but between those benchmarks has served as CEO of Citi’s private bank, CEO of Citi Holdings, and CFO of the bank’s Institutional Clients Group, according to hisLinkedIn profile. “Serving as CFO for the last seven years and contributing to a leadership team that is redefining expectations for Citi stands as one of the most demanding and fulfilling chapters of my career,” Mason said in a statement Thursday. “I know that Gonzalo will work tirelessly with the strong team we’ve built across Finance to further Citi’s momentum, and I am fully committed to his smooth transition into the new role.” Scott Siefers, a managing director and senior research analyst for Piper Sandler, called Mason’s departure “an unfortunate loss” for Citi. “Thankfully, he will be succeeded by an insider with deep experience,” Siefers wrote in a note seen by Banking Dive. Luchetti joined Citi in 2006 and has served, among other roles, as consumer banking chief for Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and as global head of wealth management and insurance, according to hisLinkedIn profile. He became head of U.S. personal banking in 2021 and on Thursday earned plaudits from Fraser for expanding his segment’s return on tangible common equity to 14.5% for 2025’s third quarter. “I knew exactly what we needed in our next CFO to build on Mark’s successful tenure,” Fraser said. “In addition to the table-stakes requirement of superb financial acumen, it must be someone who is strategically minded, data-driven, analytical, and an excellent operator. … Gonzalo is that person.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-mark-mason-cfo-step-down-march-gonzalo-luchetti-fraser-sieg-luft-habner/806137/,,
Wells Fargo taps Saul Van Beurden to scale AI,"Saul Van Beurden, chief executive of Wells Fargo consumer and small business banking,has been tappedto scale artificial intelligence at the bank, the lender said Thursday. Additionally, the bank’s CEO for consumer lending, Kleber Santos, will take on added responsibilities as co-CEO of consumer lending and banking as Wells formally combines the businesses, allowing Van Beurden to focus more on AI. “Generative and agentic AI will reshape competitive dynamics across every industry, and we are embracing these tools as we have embraced robotic process automation and machine learning for years,” Wells CEO Charlie Scharf said in a prepared statement. In August, Wells gave branch bankers, investment bankers, customer relations and corporate teamsaccess to AI agents and toolsfrom Google Cloud. The tools help employees sort through massive loads of documentation and provide real-time market insights, among other things. Wells is among banks in a near-ubiquitous industry pushtoward AI-fueled efficiencies. Wells has trained some 90,000 employees on AI this year, deployed AI tools to many others and is now broadening its uses, Scharf said. “Our employees and customers have powerful models in their hands. They expect the same at work,” Van Beurden toldForbesthis month on AI. “GenAI helps remove simple repetitive tasks, builds workflows and frees people to do higher-value work. We are scratching the surface.” The key is to deploy AI in ways that “enhance human performance rather than replace it,” he told Forbes. In his enhanced role, Van Beurden will help leaders in Wells’ businesses oversee transformation in their own segments, Scharf said in a prepared statement. “Success will be driven by business heads embracing these new technologies and rethinking their own operating models using generative and agentic AI solutions,” Scharf said. The advances in AI, he added, “have given us a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform how we work and we are excited by what we can deliver for our employees, customers and communities.” Van Beurden joined Wells in2019 from JPMorgan Chase, where he was chief information officer of consumer and community banking. The San Francisco-based bankelevated him in 2023from head of technology to CEO of consumer and small-business banking. A Wells spokesperson had no comment on the new appointments, or on AI adoption as a whole.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/wells-fargo-saul-van-beurden-ai-kleber-santos-expanded-responsibilities/806195/,,
CFPB is transferring its cases to DOJ,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is transferring all of its active litigation to the Justice Department, according to separate statements Thursday from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, and the workers union representing the agency. Further, Mike Salemi, the CFPB’s acting enforcement chief, said at an all-hands meeting Thursday that, as he understood it, all bureau employees would be furloughed at the end of the year,Government Executivereported, citing people familiar with the matter. Salemi hedged, saying he was not privy to all of the plans, but that the information came from an associate general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget who also serves as a senior legal adviser at the CFPB. The timeline, if true, would dovetail with a projection CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought made in a podcast appearance last month, when he said the only employees left at the bureau were “our Republican appointees and a few career [staff] that are doing statutory responsibilities while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the nexttwo, three months,” Vought said. Further, DOJ attorneys filed paperwork last week with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, indicating the CFPB “anticipates exhaustingits currently available funds in early 2026.” The filing was meant to flag a “potential lapse in appropriations” to pay the bureau’s operating expenses. The court this year granted apreliminary injunctionpreventing the CFPB from firing the vast majority of its staff. Included in the filing was a memo the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel sent Vought, asserting that the bureau may not legally request funds at this time from the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. Salemi on Thursday said the 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation, according to Government Executive. A few top officials may have the opportunity to work for DOJ,American Bankerreported, citing people who were part of the all-hands call. Salemi noted that the DOJ stood up an enforcement and affirmative litigation unit within its Civil Division in September. Salemi told CFPB staff he assumed the agency’s work would be routed there beginning in 2026, according to Government Executive. Cat Farman, president of the National Treasury Employees Union 335, which represents CFPB employees, said Vought has “no legal authority” to transfer the bureau’s cases to the DOJ. “This is Russ Vought’s latest illegal power grab in his ongoing plan to shut down the CFPB,” Farman said in a statement on theNTEU’s website. However, the Dodd-Frank Act indicates the DOJ has the authority to handle cases where no agency is designated to do so by law,Bloomberg Lawreported. Before the CFPB was established in 2011, the DOJ took cases under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act because no other agency had the power. The CFPB is still litigating 13 cases, Farman said, though Vought this year has dismissed 22 enforcement actions brought by the bureau under previous administrations. “CFPB attorneys are afraid DOJ will dismiss [the remaining] cases,” Farman said. The DOJ declined to comment. The CFPB didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Warren, the senator credited as the architect of the bureau, appeared to hold tight to her suspicions. “Donald Trump and Russ Vought are racing to shut down the CFPB while their lawyers tell the courts the opposite,”Warren wrotein a statement Thursday. “Nobody is fooled about the Trump-Vought end game, and the courts must uphold the law.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-transfer-litigation-doj-enforcement-furloughs-salemi-vought/806193/,,
"TD illegally targeted, fired Chinese-heritage employees: lawsuit","Five former TD Bank employees of Chinese heritage say the bank illegally fired them in the wake of TD’s fentanyl-tied money laundering scandal,court documents show. Plaintiffs Andrew Wong, Ka Po Wong, Anne Louie, April Ng and Millie Su allege that TD “intentionally targeted and disproportionately impacted the bank’s Chinese and Chinese American employees” to placate investigators as they probed the lender’santi-money laundering control issues, and to “give the appearance of robust AML procedures.” The bank’s “robust enforcement” went “far beyond the normal scope” in investigating the employees’ personal transaction histories, particularly cash exchanges that moved through their bank accounts, the plaintiffs said. Chinese families traditionally borrow money from family and friends, rather than banks, and it’s common for family members to gift funds for large purchases, such as a house, plaintiffs said, citing a “financial culture [that] is prevalent in the Chinese diaspora, including the Chinese-American community.” The investigators did not take that into account, the plaintiffs asserted. In one instance, investigators pressed Ng on a $500 transaction in new bills meant as a gift during Chinese New Year, a custom. In another, investigators questioned Su about $15,000 in cash she received from family members. The funds, intended as a house down payment gift to a family associate, were deposited into Su’s account. She added $5,000 from her account, and wrote the associate a $20,000 check. “The targeted Chinese and Chinese American employees provided proof that transactions questioned by TD were legitimate, yet each still suffered the most severe adverse employment action possible. They were terminated,” plaintiffs allege. “More callously, the terminated Chinese and Chinese American were demarketed from TD Bank. TD closed their personal and business accounts, and, upon information and belief, barred them from banking with TD in the future.” Prior to the fentanyl-tied AML investigation, TD “leveraged the national origin of its Chinese and Chinese American employees to foster trust in the Chinese community and build their business,” plaintiffs said. During the investigation, however, TD’s Chinese and Chinese American employees “were then targeted by the bank because of their ethnicity and national origin. They were punished for crimes committed by other Chinese individuals — crimes they were not involved in by individuals they did not know.” “Their Chinese heritage, once used by TD Bank to garner trust in the Chinese community, now became a target for TD,” plaintiffs said. Due to TD’s investigations of its Chinese and Chinese American employees in the New York City’s Chinatown branches alone, at least 22 employees were terminated or subject to adverse employment actions, the lawsuit asserted. All but one of the terminated employees were of Chinese origin. At least one employee was terminated for a transaction with a Chinese American employee, according to court documents. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement at their respective jobs, back pay and emotional damages sustained as a result of TD’s conduct. A TD spokesperson told Banking Dive that the bank has no comment, given that the litigation is pending. Arthur Schwartz, an attorney for the plaintiffs, did not respond to a request for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/td-illegally-targeted-fired-chinese-heritage-employees-lawsuit/806066/,,

Capital One joins FedNow,"Capital One joined the Federal Reserve’s instant payments system FedNow this week, leaving Bank of America and Truist among the major U.S. financial institutions not participating in that real-time ecosystem. Capital One started its FedNow participation Tuesday, a spokesperson for the bank said by email. “Financial Institutions of all sizes are rapidly enabling instant payments for their accountholders,” U.S. Faster Payments Council CEO Reed Luhtanen said by email, when asked for comment on how the system is developing. “The ability to offer instant money movement is becoming table stakes in our 21st century economy, and financial institutions that don’t have a faster payments strategy need to develop one, and fast.” A spokesperson for Bank of America didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson confirmed late last month that the bank had not yet joined FedNow. FedNow has attracted all but two of theeight biggest U.S. retail banks, according to a list of participants on theFederal Reserve’s FedNow website. The service allows for the transfer of payments between banks in seconds or minutes, as opposed to some alternatives that take days. While about 1,550 U.S. financial institutions have joined the FedNow system since itlaunched in July 2023, there are thousands that have not, despite the central bank’s efforts to attract smaller banks as well. In all, there are about 9,000 U.S. financial institutions, including large banks, smaller regional and community banks, and credit unions. (Only U.S. financial institutions are allowed to connect to the FedNow system.) Nonetheless, the large banks are the most active in the payments sphere. The 50 biggest banks operating in the U.S. account for more than 90% of payment originations on the major clearing systems operated by The Clearing House andNacha, based on those organizations’ statistics. To smooth the way to joining the system, the Fed is trying to make it as easy as possible. Currently, the “record” time period for onboarding a bank — from signing a contract with the central bank to offering services — is seven days, FedNow Chief Executive Nick Stanescusaid in a video poston FedNow’s website Tuesday. He noted there are also 41 certified service providers that aid in bringing bank clients to the system. To boost transaction volume, FedNow has been gradually increasing the maximum amount that can be sent over the system.

Lloyds to buy UK fintech Curve,"London-based Lloyds Bank will buy theU.K. fintech Curve, the bankannounced Wednesday. Lloyds did not disclose the price point for the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2026. But the acquisition lends credence to aSky Newsreport from last week, indicating the bank would pay £120 million for the digital wallet provider. That’s less than half the £250 million in funding Curve is said to have raised since its founding in 2015. And it’s far below the valuation CEO Shachar Bialick had targeted for the company. “In ten years’ time we are going to be IPO-ed … and hopefully worth around $50 billion to $60 billion,” Bialick, a former Israeli special forces soldier, toldThe Times of Londonin 2019, using the acronym for initial public offering. In a circular to investors last week, Curve said it “share[s] the disappointment some of you may have in this outcome.” “We recognize that the value of this transaction falls short of the ambitions we all held for Curve,” the company said in the note, seen by Sky News. “Yet, the board strongly believes this transaction represents the best available path forward for Curve's creditors and shareholders as a whole."" However, IDC Ventures, an investor that holds a 12% stake in Curve, said in a statement Friday it is ""deeply concerned about the conduct of Curve's management and board during the current sale process."" IDC alleged a small group of directors and investors at Curve “facilitated corporate decision-making to entrench control and override shareholder rights,” adding that “issues regarding [Curve’s] governance and ownership are disputed.” The investor sought toremove Curve's chairin September, but the effort failed. IDC has consistently opposed a sale to Lloyds since rumors of a potential transaction became public in July. The investor wrote “repeatedly” to Curve and its board, opposing the sale, “without receiving any meaningful response or engagement,” it asserted in September. IDC also said it wrote to Lloyds, but the bank did not respond. “It is a matter of real surprise to shareholders that Lloyds Banking Group, a leading UK institution, would contemplate proceeding with a transaction that IDC believes is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders,” IDC wrote Friday, adding it “does not believe” a sale could be “implemented” without the investor’s support. Curve’s auditors earlier this year had warned of “material uncertainty” at the firm, according toCityAM. Financial figures published in March revealed the company had paused its plans to expand to the U.S. and, in 2023, cut about a third of its workforce, according totech.eu. Curve reported a pretax loss of £36 million in 2023, up from £69 million the year before. Bialick, when asked if Curve would be profitable in 2024, said the company’s “priority is sustainable expansion, and we anticipate reaching break-even in the near term.” Curve touts a digital wallet platform that brings all of a user’s cards and alternative payment sources into one place, while offering payment flexibility, real-time spend insights and no foreign exchange fees. In a statement onCurve’s blog Wednesday, Bialick said Curve’s “mission” has always been to “simplify and supercharge people’s finances.” “Joining forces with Lloyds Banking Group means we can now scale that vision faster, helping tens of millions more customers unlock smarter payments, and empower greater financial accessibility,” he said. Curve, on its own, counts 6 million customers. Lloyds, by comparison, reaches 28 million. The bank announced in January it planned toclose 136 branchesin the U.K. as customers rely more heavily on digital banking. Buying a digital wallet platform, presumably, would dovetail with that vision. “Building on the innovative changes we’ve made to our app recently, integrating Curve’s cutting-edge technology and digital wallet capabilities will deliver a next-generation digital banking experience for our customers as we help them to take control of their finances in a simple and convenient way,” Jas Singh, CEO of consumer relationships at Lloyds, said in a release Wednesday. Lloyds said Wednesday the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the bank, or to affect full-year guidance for 2025 or 2026.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/lloyds-bank-uk-acquire-fintech-curve-digital-wallet-120-million-idc-investor-concern/806065/,,
NY AG’s office scrutinizes SoLo Funds,"Fintech lender SoLo Funds is engaged with the New York attorney general’s office related to usury concerns, an executive said this week. Denzel Singletary, head of government affairs and strategic partnerships at the company, said SoLo Funds was served a subpoena this year by state AG Letitia James’ office. “We're in negotiations with them now, figuring out … what common ground looks like,” Singletary said, speaking Monday at the Banking Transformation Summit in Charlotte, North Carolina, on the topic of fintechs and regulators working together. James’ office declined to comment Tuesday. After SoLo Funds was subpoenaed, “my job initially was to make sure New York knew that we were not working in a nefarious way,” Singletary said. He said he highlighted the fintech’s community platform and tried to dispel misconceptions customers are being charged exorbitant interest rates. SoLo Funds bills itself as a community finance platform. Its business model has drawn the attention of regulators in a handful of states who view its “tip” structure asa predatory lending practice. In recent years, SoLo hasreached agreements with regulatorsin California, Washington, D.C., Connecticut and Pennsylvania related toallegations borrowers were required to pay large “tips” to access loans through its platform. In May 2024,the Los Angeles-based fintech was suedby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau,then under the Biden administration, also took issue with SoLo’s “tip” structure, which it said obscured the total cost of loans. The CFPB also said SoLo, which marketed itself as a consumer-friendly alternative to pricier, short-term loans, hid from borrowers the option to forgo a tip, and offered loans to borrowers in states that require platforms to have a license. SoLo said it had long since changed some components of its display the CFPB called out in the lawsuit. In February, under the Trump administration, the CFPBdropped the lawsuitagainst SoLo Funds. Russ Vought, the CFPB’s acting director who also leads the OMB, said at the time that the bureau under former director Rohit Chopra “shockingly” tried to “destroy” SoLo, “which incurred millions in legal fees and had to lay off 30% of its workforce.” “It was wrong and we dismissed the case,” Vought said. Prior tojoining SoLo Funds in 2024, Singletary was the director of U.S. government affairs at investing fintech Robinhood. “When SoLo Funds reached out to me to come and work with them,” he said, “it was this opportunity of figuring out, how do I make this fintech work well with regulators? What can I do to strengthen this relationship with this particular fintech and regulators?” That task was made far more difficult when, two weeks after he joined SoLo Funds, the firm was sued by the CFPB. He called that “a very interesting intro into the company,” but said he wasn’t deterred in seeking to make sure the regulator and the fintech understood each other. Then came a “blessing” in the form of the presidential administration change in January, Singletary said. “It was an opportunity for us to state our case in front of a new body, really,” he said. In doing that, the fintech focused on its community of users. “What does this whole community look like? What is this application actually doing? Who is it actually helping?” he said. “The customers are always going to make it make sense for the regulators,” he said. “I highlighted the fact that even though there's misconceptions, that we were facing those and actually working through them.” SoLo Funds became the first company to have a lawsuit dismissed by the current CFPB, which has since dropped a number of lawsuits filed under the Biden administration. “I genuinely think that's because we highlighted the community,” Singletary said. “Bodies really matter” when it comes to cooperation between fintechs and regulators.

Travis Holoway and Rodney Williams, the founders of SoLo Funds, soughtto establish an alternative to costly payday lenders, Singletary said. They“were two college-educated men who had made it, and their friends and family were consistently asking them for loans,” Singletary said. SoLo Funds, which launched in 2018, offers checking accounts and debit cards, and through its loan marketplace, members can request loans that other users can fund.

Senators back open banking rule,"Several Senate Democrats on Thursday called on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to keep pursuing open banking rules that give consumers the ability to easily shift their personal data from one financial institution to another. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut pressed CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought in a letter seen by Payments Dive to continue the federal agency’s work in writing a rule under the Dodd-Frank Act that would further such consumer rights, without fees. The agency issued such a rule last year during the Biden administration, but bank trade groups sued over the regulation and it has been tied up in court. Under Vought’s leadership, the agency stopped backing the Biden-era rule in the litigation, which a judge has stayed, pending the agency’s decision to rewrite the rule. At the same time, Vought is aggressively shrinking the agency and threatening to shutter it, leaving the rule’s future in doubt. “We are concerned that the Trump CFPB’s policymaking seems to be more driven by the seesawing interests of big banks and other industry groups than with protecting consumers’ rights to their own data, as mandated by law,” the senators wrote in their letter. The senators alsoissued a press releaseThursday, insisting Vought reinstate the priorPersonal Financial Data Rights rule. “In the absence of the rule, big banks have demonstrated that they intend to charge exorbitant fees for this data to choke off competition and concentrate this data in the hands of a few large incumbents,” the senators wrote. The senators also contended that banks should not be allowed to charge for access to the data, saying it would be a violation of the law. “Large financial institutions have a monopoly over large swaths of consumer data and thus have the potential to drive out competitors and start ups in the data sharing market,” the letter said. The senators specifically called out JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, for imposing fees this year on third-party data aggregators, including the fintech Plaid. That bank’s fees were “at rates high enough to paralyze the market,” the letter said, noting that PayPal’s peer-to-peer payment tool Venmo and neobank Chime use Plaid to connect users’ bank accounts to their apps. JPMorgan Chase was set to impose an estimated $300 million in new fees annually on Plaid, the senators said, citing an article from Forbes, before the companies reached an agreement in September on terms that weren’t disclosed. JPMorgan Chase’s initial fee structure “indicates where the market may be moving absent the CFPB’s rule,” the letter said. A second data aggregator, Yodlee, this month said it had reached anupdated agreementwith JPMorgan Chase over access fees. The senators argued that “it is critical that any revisions the CFPB makes to the Personal Financial Data Rights rule recognize the importance of consumers being able to exercise their rights, which includes deciding how and by whom their data is used.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/open-banking-cfpb-warren-wyden-blumenthal-vought-jpmorgan-plaid-chime-venmo-yodlee/806190/,,
Florida credit union to buy Georgia bank,"Jacksonville, Florida-based Community First Credit Union of Florida will buy Waycross, Georgia-based First Southern Bank, creating a $3.3 billion-asset institution, thecredit union announced Tuesday. The deal, which would extend the credit union’s footprint into southeast Georgia and elsewhere into Florida, is thesecond CU-bank tie-up announced this week,after El Paso, Texas-based GECU proposed buying Roswell, New Mexico-based Bank of the Southwest on Monday. “While we love the growth opportunities that come with the transaction, this acquisition is founded on a unified vision between Community First and First Southern Bank,” Sam Inman, CEO of Community First, said in a prepared statement. “Both institutions emphasize a community-oriented and relationship-based approach, maintaining a culture that respects individuals and prioritizes service excellence.” Both institutions are storied: Community First is 90 years old. First Southern is 118 years old. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both institutions, is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2026. After that, First Southern’s holding company will liquidate, dissolve and distribute any remaining assets to its stockholders. The new Community First will count roughly $2.5 billion in loans and $2.9 billion in deposits across 31 branches. “First Southern Bank customers will continue to see their trusted familiar banker at each location,” said First Southern CEO Daniel Hager in a prepared statement. “The newly combined institution will have the ability to offer highly personalized financial services, which will enable us the financial capabilities to support further expansion.” Community First plans to retain all First Southern employees, stretching its headcount to 530. “Combining will expand services and strengthen community impact,” Community First said in a Q&A on its website. Tie-ups between credit unions and banks are not without challengers.Independent Community Bankers of America CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey released a statement Tuesday calling for policymakers “to address the harmful impact these deals have on local communities.” CitingICBA data, Rainey said the deals harm “small businesses and local communities while community banks outperform credit unions in high-poverty areas.” She called for Congress to eliminate the federal tax exemption for credit unions with more than $1 billion in assets. More than 80% of deals since 2010 have involved credit unions of that size, ICBA found. Four in 10 deals have involved a credit union headquartered in a different state than the acquired bank. Small Business Administration lending fell almost 80% at community banks that were acquired by credit unions, according to ICBA, and the amount loaned per approved mortgage application at the institutions decreased 61%. Michael Bell, a partner at Honigman who often architects such deals – including this one – told Banking Dive that ICBA’s statements are without “substance.” “The ICBA equates size to evil for some reason,” he said. “I ask the ICBA, is a $1 billion community bank still a community bank? Should all community banks larger than $1 billion give up the many tax subsidies enjoyed by community banks?”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/florida-credit-union-buy-georgia-bank/805897/,,
White House nominates Vought aide to lead CFPB,"Additionally, Geof Gradler was named deputy director of the CFPB. He’s a former lobbyist who joined the bureau about four months ago, according tohis LinkedIn profile. The CFPB spokesperson declined to comment on the fate of the agency, or whether the bureau intended to make a similar move in another 210 days. Vought said last monthon a podcast that onlyRepublican appointees and a few career employees remain “while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months,” Vought said. Trump administration officials have tried repeatedly this yearto hobble or shutterthe agency but have, at times run into court-ordered roadblocks. The CFPB spokesperson said the hearing process likely will be a moot point for Levenbach. The Senate probably wouldn’t get around to it until next year, the spokesperson said, and with Vought not going anywhere, the formal process may not occur. Michael Emancipator, senior vice president and regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America,noted on LinkedInWednesday that Levenbach’s nomination appears to be “merely a resetting of the clock” under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. And McGuireWoods partner Jeff Ehrlich, a former deputy enforcement director at the CFPB, said the nomination is “likely a placeholder,” according toa LinkedIn post. The spokesperson pointed toa news releasethe bureau issued last week, in which the CFPB said itinformed the court inNTEU v. Voughtthat the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the CFPBcan’t legally request fundsfrom the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB “anticipates having sufficient funds to continue operations until at least December 31,” the release said.DOJ attorneys told the court that available funds are expected to run out in early 2026. Levenbach is also vice chair of theNational Capital Planning Commission, a panel that Voughtthreatened to involvein this summer’s dust-up over an over-budget renovation at the Federal Reserve. Levenbach served as chief of staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during Trump’s first term. Later, he became a senior adviser with the White House National Economic Council and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, according tohis LinkedIn profile. Prior to those roles, he spent about a decade at OMB. “Donald Trump’s sending the Senate a new nominee to lead the CFPB looks like nothing more than a front for Russ Vought to stay on as Acting Director indefinitely as he tries to illegally close down the agency,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a Wednesday statement. “Instead of doing everything in their power to lower costs for Americans, Trump and Vought want to make it easier for giant corporations to scam families out of their money.” Consumer Bankers Association CEO Lindsey Johnson said Levenbach’s nomination “comes at a critical time for consumers and the financial services marketplace.” “America’s leading Main Street banks look forward to continuing to work with the Trump Administration on data-driven, pro-growth policies that will support hardworking Americans and drive the economy forward, while at the same time ensuring the Bureau fulfills its statutory mission and sticks to what Congress authorized it to do,” she said in a Wednesday statement. “This will not only help restore the trust and credibility of the CFPB, but will benefit consumers, industry, and the broader economy alike.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-director-levenbach-vought-omb-trump/805913/,,
LevelField gets state approval to buy Chicago bank,"LevelField filed a fresh application to buy Burling inDecember 2024. In that paperwork, the Houston firm said it would pay roughly $70 million for the bank, which counts a single branch and $209.5 million in assets. The combined entity will be renamed LevelField Bank but maintain Burling’s community banking business. However, it will add a focus on deposit accounts, loans and custody services tailored to digital assets, including term loans and credit cards secured by bitcoin or Ether, according to the application. Burling's CEO, Michael Busch, will become president of LevelField Bank, Grant said. From the beginning, LevelField said it sought to become the first full-service chartered bank to offer traditional banking and digital asset services on one platform across the U.S. ""The idea is, once we have a customer, they don't have to go outside the bank perimeter for anything they want to do in digital assets,” Grant told American Banker. Grant said he expects acquisition to be finalized by the end of this year. Only Burling’s cannabis banking business will retain the Burling brand, LevelField said. To accommodate the anticipated round-the clock needs of its digital-asset user base, LevelField aims to hire roughly 100 employees in 2026 – mostly in customer service, Grant said. Once LevelField receives regulatory approval, it aims to raise $112.5 million, according to its December 2024 filing. That is meant to cover the acquisition of the bank, $20 million in growth capital and $17.5 million that LevelField will retain, the company said. In a release Monday, Grant thanked investors “for backing the patient, disciplined work it took to meet the necessary supervisory standards that protect consumers and businesses and make the U.S. the home of the world leading banking system."" As far as embracing crypto, Grant said the banking system can either ""live in denial or we can try to safely integrate it … in such a way that it works collaboratively and doesn't endanger the system."" “Financial services must be changed from the inside, and unlike other industries, outside disruptors barely move the needle,” Granttold Bloomberg.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/levelfield-acquire-burling-bank-illinois-regulator-approval-crypto-digital-asset/805947/,,
FDIC countersues Capital One over special assessment,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. accused Capital One of paying $99.4 million less than necessary to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund following the 2023 failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, according tocourt documents filed Monday. The FDIC’s lawsuit countered legal action takenin Septemberagainst the regulator by the bank, which alleged the FDICimposed an “outsized and improperly calculated” special assessment fee on Capital One. The FDIC inflated its assessment against Capital One by $149.2 million, the bank said in September. At issue is a $56 billion position between two Capital One subsidiaries which, according to Monday’s lawsuit, Capital One excluded in its reporting of uninsured deposits. Capital One said the agency “erroneously” included the position as uninsured deposits, inflating what the bank owed. The FDIC used funds from the DIF to protect uninsured depositors when banks fail. When SVB and Signature Bank were seized by the FDIC in March 2023, most of their deposits – 88% and 67%, respectively – were above the FDIC’s $250,000 threshold and “uninsured.” To recoup DIF funds later that year, the FDIC implemented a special assessment on the nation’s largest banks, including Capital One. The FDIC argued Monday that Capital One benefits from deposit insurance, and that the funds were “deposits held at the bank for which the subsidiary already received the benefit of FDIC deposit insurance.” ""There are no time machines when it comes to special assessments,” the FDIC said. Capital One and the FDIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fdic-countersues-capital-one-over-special-assessment/805937/,,
JPMorgan Chase enhancing due diligence for clients in the Amazon region,"The change itself does not come with any inherent restrictions on client activities or transactions in the region, but a JPMorgan spokesperson told ESG Dive on Wednesday that each activity and transaction will be considered “on a case-by-case basis, in line with [its] risk appetite and commercial interests.” “Managing risk is critical to the long-term success of our business,” the bank’s spokesperson said in emailed comments. “We added Amazon Biome as one example of a business location associated with clients and/or transactions we consider sensitive or in need of enhanced review, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.” The RAISG geospatial definition, which JPMorgan will use to define the biome, “is widely recommended by Indigenous leaders and activists,” according to Stand.earth. Allison Fajans-Turner, a senior campaigner at the Rainforest Action Network — one of the environmental organizations backing the annual Banking on Climate Chaos reports — said requiring enhanced due diligence for activities in the Amazon biome is “the bare minimum that we should expect from other large backers of Amazon drilling.” “JPMorgan Chase has finally taken an essential — if long-overdue — step to confront its role as the largest financier of oil and gas extraction in the Amazon,” Fajans-Turner said in Stand.earth’s Nov. 13 release. After 30% of JPMorgan’s shareholders supported a proposal to require the bank to issue a report on its practices on Indigenous People's rights in the 2024 proxy season, JPMorgan reached an agreement with shareholders proposing a similar filing in the most recent proxy season. The United Church Fundwithdrew its proposal to the bankin April — afterJPMorgan submitted a no-action requeston the filing — once the bank agreed to add a disclosure stating “the company will consider free, prior and informed consent where risks are identified before proceeding with transactions that may have material implications for Indigenous Peoples.” “Promises on paper to respect Indigenous and human rights and screen clients operating in the Amazon biome fall far short of what’s needed: real financing exclusions applied to the Amazon and other fragile ecosystems and rigorous implementation of human rights protections for Indigenous peoples and all affected local communities,” Fajans-Turner said in the Nov. 13 release. In addition to the Arctic and the Amazon, JPMorgan requires a case-by-case enhanced review for coal mining and coal-fired power activities; clients whose “main business is the physical trading of conflict minerals,” cobalt or diamond trading; and hydropower, agricultural commodities or downstream agricultural commodity use in non-designated countries.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-enhancing-due-diligence-amazon-region-clients-standearth/806007/,,
Investor blasts Comerica over Fifth Third deal,"Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management on Monday probed Comerica’s $10.9 billion deal to be acquired by Fifth Third and threatened legal action against the bank if more information on the deal process isn’t released. Additionally, Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions was Comerica’s first suitor, before the Dallas-based bank struck a deal with Fifth Third,American Bankerreported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Spokespeople for Regions and Fifth Third declined to comment. A Comerica spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July,accusing the regional lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” HoldCo, whichowns about 2.04 million shares of Comerica stock,suggested PNC, Fifth Third or Huntington as possible buyers. In October, Fifth Third said it wasacquiring Comerica for $10.9 billionin stock. Earlier this month,a regulatory filingrevealed that the Cincinnati-based lender was not Comerica’s first suitor. The CEO of another bank, identified as Financial Institution A in the filing, proposed an all-stock transaction with $78 billion-asset Comerica in September. But Comerica’s board determined the terms “were not likely to be more attractive than the consideration that could be offered by another counterparty.” HoldCo’s65-page presentation issued Monday, which parsed recent regulatory filings, alleged a lack of board oversight in Comerica CEO Curt Farmer’s interactions with Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence and the absence of a competitive process in the Fifth Third deal, saying “this isn’t negotiation; it’s surrender.” HoldCo accused Comerica’s board of ignoring Financial Institution A’s proposals, a choice it called “indefensible,” and contended “had you engaged, we believe those ‘preliminary’ bids would have matured into definitive proposals — at likely materially higher levels.” HoldCo also critiqued Farmer’s “windfall” – he’s set to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks – and the deal’s “aggressive” breakup fee of $500 million. The acquisition is set to face a shareholder vote in January. HoldCo demanded a raft of details, calling on Comerica to “provide a more complete and transparent chronology of the events leading up to the Fifth Third transaction.” That includes when the board first discussed potential responses to shareholder pressure and when it authorized Comerica management to explore a merger, as well as information on the identity of Financial Institution A, the timing, substance and financial terms of its proposals, and whether Comerica or its advisers engaged with that bank. “The apparent absence of any follow-up engagement with a bidder who made an offer — combined with the lack of evidence that J.P. Morgan sought to create competition between bidders — suggests a process engineered to favor Fifth Third rather than one designed to maximize shareholder value,” the activist investor said. HoldCo also pressed for details on the decision to hire JPMorgan Chase as Comerica’s financial adviser, and seeks more specifics related to Farmer’s conversations with Spence. “The size and timing of Mr. Farmer’s compensation package strongly indicate a potential conflict of interest — namely, that Fifth Third effectively ‘overpaid’ the CEO to secure a lower purchase price for shareholders,” the activist said. If the bank doesn’t provide the requested detail, “we will have to consider seeking expedited relief in the Delaware Court of Chancery to obtain the disclosures we believe are warranted,” HoldCo said. The activist may also consider bringing fiduciary-duty claims in the Delaware court. In recent months, Regions executives have repeatedly expressed disinterest in acquiring a bank, instead eyeing the opportunity to snag customers and talentamid disruption caused by other M&Aactivity. Regions CFO David Turner reiterated those views this month at theBancAnalysts Association of Boston conference– which would have been after the bank reportedly proposed a deal with Comerica. “We're, I think, the only bank that hadn't done an acquisition since 2006,” Turner said Nov. 7. The bank had just finished its strategic plan, “and M&A is not part of that plan,” he said. “It's just not part of where we want to focus our time and attention. And we understand things can change, but that's just not where we are today,” Turner added. Still, one analyst noted some wonder whether the bank’s position may change. “With increased M&A activity in their Southeast backyard, there have been investors who wonder if [Regions management] would start to feel compelled to take part in the M&A wave, particularly since the company is profitable but has had challenges growing organically,” Truist Securities analyst Brian Finneran wrote in a Tuesday note.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/holdco-activist-comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-regions/805807/,,
Revolut valued at $75B,"Revolut is valued at $75 billion after completing a share sale, theBritish fintech said Monday. Revolut did not disclose how many shares were sold or the amount raised. It’s the fifth share sale Revolut has allowed its staff to date, with the fintech asserting it’s “one of the most liquid employee share programmes across private companies in the industry.” The new valuation marks significant growth sinceRevolut’s $45 billion valuation 15 months ago, which came directly after it received its long-awaitedBritish banking license. Since then, Revolut has entered multiple markets,named a chairof its Western Europe arm and finalized itsbanking license in Mexico. It’s also exploring U.S. growth, with Revolut U.S. CEO Sid Jajodia saying in October thatnabbing a stateside charteris part of the firm’s growth “mission.” “The level of investor interest and our new valuation reflect the strength of our business model, which is delivering both rapid growth and strong profitability,” CFO Victor Stinga said in a prepared statement on the recent share sale. “We welcome onboard a series of world-class investors and look forward to working with them for the next stage in Revolut’s evolution.” The transaction was led by Coatue, Greenoaks, Dragoneer and Fidelity Management & Research Company. Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Andreessen Horowitz, Franklin Templeton and T. Rowe Price Associates also participated. In ablog postMonday, Coatue wrote that it sees Revolut “charting a new path.” “They are building the world’s first global financial super-app, which is now operating in 39 countries and serves over 65 million users,” wrote Brendan O’Boyle, Rohan Bharvani and Lucas Swisher, investors at Coatue, which also led Revolut’s 2024 funding round. “What began as a travel card designed to avoid high [foreign exchange] fees has evolved into a multi-product financial platform that is redefining what modern banking looks like for consumers and businesses.” Revolut’s 2024 revenue grew 72% to $4 billion year over year, with profit before tax more than doubling to $1.4 billion. Its Revolut Business arm hit $1 billion in annualized revenue in 2025, the company said. The new valuation “reflects the remarkable progress we have made in the last twelve months towards our vision of building the first truly global bank, serving 100 million customers across 100 countries,” CEO Nik Storonsky said in a prepared statement.

"Comerica, Fifth Third sued by activist investor","Just days after threatening legal action against Comerica, HoldCo Asset Management has sued the regional bank and its proposed buyer, Fifth Third. The activist investor accused Comerica CEO Curt Farmer of being “focused solely on advancing his own interests” based on the “rushed” way the Dallas-based bank’s proposed$10.9 billion acquisition by Fifth Thirdcame together. Theclass-action complaint, filed Friday in the Delaware Court of Chancery by HoldCo Opportunities Fund, alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by Comerica and its board members related to the transaction and its “draconian” provisions. It also accuses the bank of leaving out material information from disclosures related to the deal. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCo also accused Fifth Third of “aiding-and-abetting” the board in breaching its fiduciary duty. HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July, accusing the lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” In October, Fifth Third announced it would acquire Comerica. HoldCoissued a presentationlast week that picked apart the proposed deal, threatening to take Comerica to court if it didn’t release more information on how the agreement came together. Comerica rebuffed at leastone earlier suitor, Financial Institution A, according to a disclosure. That was Regions Bank, American Banker reported. The deal between Comerica and Fifth Third was “negotiated over an extraordinarily compressed timeline,” HoldCo’s Friday complaint contends. It was driven by Farmer’s “fear of an activist contest” led by HoldCo, “and his fear that no other bidder would keep him on,” the firm alleged. “Fearing for his job, Farmer raced to find a friendly white knight that could provide him with a lucrative post-closing role,” the complaint asserts. Farmer isset to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks. Part of the rush, HoldCo claims, was to avoid any proxy contest at Comerica’s annual meeting, to have been held by May 2026. The Fifth Third deal is projected to close in the first quarter of 2026. Although Comerica received an offer from Financial Institution A, the complaint alleges the Dallas bank decided to “nip those negotiations in the bud” and solely focus on Fifth Third. The deal came together hastily and in a way that ensures “no topping bid could disrupt Farmer’s entrenchment plan,” HoldCo attorneys alleged. The merger agreement carries a “gargantuan” termination fee of $500 million and “an absurdly narrow fiduciary-out” that doesn’t let the board scrap the merger for a higher bid, HoldCo said in the complaint. The “draconian” deal protections mean Comerica’s board couldn’t terminate the acquisition for a better proposal until October 2026, even if shareholders don’t vote in favor of the deal, the filing said. HoldCo also alleges the registration statement is “materially misleading and incomplete” and doesn’t provide shareholders with any details that would allow them to compare the deal’s terms with Financial Institution A’s proposed offers. “There is no evidence from the Registration Statement that Comerica ever made a counterproposal or tried to negotiate for a price above the lowest end of the exchange ratio range in Fifth Third’s initial proposal,” the complaint said. “Nor is there any evidence that Comerica made any attempt to re-engage Financial Institution A (to see if it would provide a better proposal) or solicit interest from other potential bidders.” The 17-day span – from the start of potential merger conversations between Farmer and Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence to when an agreement was signed – “is the shortest timeframe of any of the ten largest bank mergers, with the next shortest taking 43 days and the median taking 67 days,” HoldCo contended. “Such negotiations are more reminiscent of distressed bank sales during the 2008 global financial crisis,” the complaint said. In aresponse filed Monday, attorneys for Comerica argued HoldCo’s views are at odds with those of other bank shareholders, and blasted the activist for “asking this Court to deprive stockholders of a merger after agitating for just such a deal.” Fifth Third’s attorneys, in aseparate Monday filing, called HoldCo’s aiding and abetting assertion a “facially meritless claim.” “This case is only about HoldCo’s self-serving activism goals,” Fifth Third’s attorneys said. Comerica and Fifth Third attorneys accused HoldCo of “gamesmanship” and called its claims weak. Comerica’s lawyers also needled HoldCo for “revel[ing] in its notoriety” after pushing for the bank to sell itself and seeking credit for the outcome. Comerica’s attorneys also noted HoldCo was in communication with the bank’s counsel in the days leading up to filing Friday’s complaint. “At no time during those communications did HoldCo indicate it would be filing a suit to enjoin the deal on Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week,” Comerica’s attorneys said. The shareholder vote on the acquisition is tentatively scheduled for Jan. 6. A hearing was set to be held Tuesday related to a motion to expedite the case. Spokespeople for Comerica and Fifth Third declined to comment. Attorneys withBernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman, the law firm representing HoldCo, didn’t return requests for comment.

Fulton Financial to buy NJ’s Blue Foundry in $243M deal,"Fulton Financial Corp.will acquire Blue Foundry Bancorpin an all-stock transaction valued at $243 million, the companies announced Monday. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, pushes Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based Fulton into northern New Jersey. The bank gained a presence in the southern part of the state last year with itsacquisition of Republic First. The Philadelphia-based bank had locations in New Jersey and New York before it failed. Acquiring $2.15 billion-asset Blue Foundry, headquartered in Rutherford, New Jersey, gives $32 billion-asset Fulton 21 additional branches in eight counties, including four of the state’s most populous. “The expansion in northern New Jersey aligns with our strategy of growing in our local markets and positions us well to drive organic growth across our commercial, consumer, wealth advisory and mortgage businesses,” Fulton CEO Curtis Myers said in a prepared statement. “The combination of our companies creates an opportunity to leverage Fulton’s robust banking services and provide greater convenience and innovative solutions to an expanded customer base, with a continued focus on supporting our local communities,” he said. Under the terms of the agreement, Blue Foundry investors will receive 0.65 shares of Fulton common stock for each share they own. The transaction’s estimated $243 million value stems from Fulton’s $17.96 share price from Friday. “Joining forces with Fulton is an exciting step forward for our employees, customers and communities,” Blue Foundry CEO James Nesci said in a prepared statement. “This partnership allows us to preserve the local relationships and personalized service our customers value, while gaining access to greater resources and providing more solutions and convenience to customers.” In recent years, Blue Foundry has been a publicly traded bank, during which time it has reported more than $20 million in losses,American Bankerreported. Activist investor Larry Seidman, who had pushed for its sale via proxy campaign last year, told American Banker there was “no question whatsoever” that Fulton would be able to produce better results than Blue Foundry has with its assets. “It's a good bank with good management,” Seidman said of Fulton. “Blue Foundry was horrible. They couldn't make any money.” The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to tangible book value per share. It’s expected to be accretive to first full-year earnings by over 5%, and neutral to regulatory capital ratios at close. As part of the deal, Fulton will make a $1.5 million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation, which provides impact grants to nonprofit community organizations in New Jersey.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fulton-financial-to-buy-nj-blue-foundry-243m-deal/806443/,,
MoneyLion to pay $1.75M to settle CFPB lawsuit,"MoneyLion agreed Friday topay $1.75 millionto settle a long-running lawsuit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, alleging the fintech charged more than the maximum 36% interest rate allowed by the Military Lending Act on loans to service members. The settlement narrows – to 12 – the number of cases the CFPB has in active litigation, based on acount given last weekby a representative of the bureau’s workers union. The CFPB has dismissed 22 enforcement actions this year. The case also bolsters the CFPB’s commitment –from April, and subsequently reinforced in a “humility pledge” Friday – to focus on providing redress to service members, veterans and their families. As part of the settlement, MoneyLion is barred from extending consumer credit at rates higher than 36% to borrowers for whom the MLA cap applies. That includes credit insurance premiums or fees, any fee for a debt cancellation contract or debt suspension agreement, or any fee for a credit-related ancillary product sold as part of a credit transaction. It also includes finance charges, application fees or membership fees. That was a focal point of the CFPB’sSeptember 2022 lawsuitagainst the company. MoneyLion required customers to join a membership program – which carried a monthly fee between $19.99 and $29 – to access the fintech’s low annual percentage rate installment loan product, the bureau said when the suit was first filed. But the company failed to allow borrowers to cancel their memberships until their loans were paid, and in some cases, wouldn’t cancel memberships if the borrower had unpaid membership fees, the CFPB added. Friday’s settlement bars MoneyLion from preventing borrowers from canceling their membership. It also does not permit the fintech to engage in collections activities for past unpaid membership fees, collecting membership fees for periods when memberships were suspended. MoneyLion also can’t prevent borrowers from paying off loans in full by using funds in their credit reserve account, according to the settlement. Nor can the company ding borrowers’ credit scores over unpaid membership fees. Also as part of the settlement, MoneyLion must submit an accurate written compliance report, sworn under penalty of perjury, to the CFPB, detailing the number of borrowers who received redress and the amount paid to each. The settlement covers borrowers who had outstanding MoneyLion loans between December 2017 and October 2024. MoneyLion, in September 2022, disputed the CFPB’s allegations, accusing the regulator of taking a “sensationalist route of prioritizing headlines instead of engaging in constructive dialogue.” “MoneyLion has the highest regard for its military and veteran customers and [is] committed to working with this important community to help them achieve better financial health,” the company said at the time. “MoneyLion is honored to serve this important segment of its customer base and is grateful for the sacrifice these men and women have made for our country.” The membership offering represents a small subset of MoneyLion’s business, the company said at the time. Since then, the fintech has come under new management: MoneyLionwas acquired this yearby Gen Digital forabout $1 billion. The CFPB is also not the only entity with a consumer-protection case against MoneyLion.New York’s attorney generalsued MoneyLion and fellow earned wage access provider DailyPay in April, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to tens of thousands of workers with fees that “amount to outrageous annual interest rates in the triple digits.” Thecity of Baltimorelast month sued MoneyLion, alleging the company misled and manipulated consumers into taking out small-dollar, short-term loans that come with high fees. MoneyLion in 2023 persuaded the judge in the CFPB case topause proceedingsahead of aSupreme Court rulingthat affirmed the bureau’s funding structure is constitutional.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-moneylion-settlement-mla-interest-rate-36-cap-military-membership-fees/806439/,,
U.S. Bank hires up for greater Southeast growth,"After adding bankers to serve businesses in Dallas and Houston, U.S. Bank is now focused on further expansion across the Southeast, a business banking executive said. Within the next six months, U.S. Bank plans to hire at least a dozen bankers in a couple of Southeast states where it doesn’t have branches, said Dee O’Dell, head of business banking sales at the Minneapolis-based lender. He didn’t elaborate, butthat group includesAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. The super-regional bank has recently added teams of bankers in markets where it’s seeing greater growth opportunity, including a second team in Charlotte, North Carolina; a second in Las Vegas; and a fourth in Chicago, O’Dell said during a recent interview. In his unit, about 250 people have been hired into new roles this year. In Houston, where the $695 billion-asset bank announced last week it added a business banking team, four people have been hired and the lender plans to bring on two more, he said. In U.S. Bank’s business banking segment, which serves companies generating between $2.5 million to $50 million in annual revenue, about 1,200 employees across the country serve about 75,000 clients, O’Dell said. The consumer and business banking segmentmakes up about 32%of the lender’s overall revenue, which was $21.3 billion year to date,as of Sept. 30. U.S. Bank provides those commercial clients with different types of credit for their capital needs, including conventional financing, owner-occupied real estate loans and Small Business Administration loans. Clients in that size range often “not only have their primary business, but they're looking for ways to diversify,” O’Dell said. “They not only want to own the building they're in, they may want to own some other buildings as well, and so we've got the ability to provide capital for them, not only for their core business, but for investment real estate.” Bankers also seek to connect clients with other U.S. Bank services, such as credit cards, merchant processing, treasury management, foreign exchange and wealth management. Amid a highly competitive landscape, the lender has sharpened efforts to offer anddeliver services to clientsin a comprehensive way, O’Dell said. “Our approach has been to integrate all that together so that there is value that comes from having all of that in one place,” he said. To zero in on where businesses could gain the most benefit, the bank developed – along with a fintech O’Dell wouldn’t name – a proprietary diagnostic tool for companies. The questionnaire assesses business needs and money movement, diagnoses the level of efficiency in those functions and has a team review results with business clients. “The idea is that instead of trying to sell any one of those products, we're approaching it in a much more consultative and holistic way,” O’Dell said. “It helps our clients see how they can be even more efficient, save time in their day, eliminate risk of fraud, other things like that.” That diagnostic effort has bolstered the bank’s success rate in serving new clients since it was introduced nearly two years ago, O’Dell said. “Sometimes our bankers will meet with a company that we don't bank with today. And if your question is, ‘Do you need any banking services?’ The answer might be, ‘No, no, everything's fine. It's all good,’” O’Dell said. “If we can get them to engage with us and have this conversation and fill out this basic template questionnaire, we can go back and provide insights. And often, it opens up a conversation where companies don't even realize the things that they are doing or not doing that could lead to so much greater efficiency.” Another newer internal tool aggregates data to give bankers a view of companies or prospects within the markets they serve, allowing them to sort by sales size, industry type or ownership of property, so they can better target clients based on potential needs, O’Dell said. SBA loans may be a prime option for some of those businesses and that’s an area of lending U.S. Bank seeks to grow further, since it can serve as a company’s entry point into the bank. U.S. Bank has doubled its SBA lending in the past two years, O’Dell said. In fiscal 2025, the bank totaled $871.2 million in SBA 7(a) loans, up 23% from the previous fiscal year,it said last month. “We've been able to use that program to help a number of companies, individuals get capital they wouldn't otherwise be able to get, and because of the way that we approach that, and our client selection in that, the loss ratio that we've had in that space has been very attractive to our shareholders,” O’Dell said. SBA lending can be ideal in some succession situations, O’Dell noted. The segment of businesses O’Dell oversees has a significant number of owners nearing the end of their careers, so the bank also aims to jump on the chance to be involved in those moments. In cases where a business owner doesn’t have a child who wants to take over, they may look to sell to a similar company or private equity firm. Or if there’s someone in the company who’s interested in acquiring it but doesn’t have the capital, the bank can use an SBA loan to help with that pursuit. “We see great opportunities to help the next generation of business owners acquire business and a current generation who are at the end of their careers, exit, monetize what they've invested in, and have this sense that their legacy will continue,” O’Dell said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/us-bank-adding-business-bankers-southeast-odell/806212/,,
VALT Bank applies for de novo charter,"A group of former U.S. Bank executives is seeking federal approval to establish VALT Bank, applications submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Nov. 13 show. The proposed bank, headquartered in Eagle, Idaho, will be fully digital and will focus on serving “digitally demanding small to midsized businesses” in the U.S., according to its application. VALT plans to offer credit and deposit products as well as treasury and cash management services, and plans to provide clients with SMB-focused automation solutions. The bank will be led by proposed director, CEO and President Matt Gediman, whose nearly two-decade U.S. Bank career culminated in three years as a managing director in the bank’s private wealth management business. “When we refer to ‘digitally demanding SMBs,’ we mean revenue-generating small and midsized businesses that use technology across their daily operations and expect the same level of technological fluency from their financial service providers,” Gediman told Banking Dive via email Monday. These are traditional businesses, he added – not tech firms or crypto companies. VALT does not plan to interact with digital assets. “Our customers are established SMBs that simply expect modern, reliable, integrated digital banking,” he said. “[O]ur model is designed to support them by making banking uncomplicated, accessible, and integrated with digital tools to run their businesses more efficiently,” he said. Former U.S. Bank Vice Chairman John Elmore is VALT’s proposed executive chair and Ross Carey, former U.S. Bank EVP of business banking and SBA division, is its proposed vice chair. Kim Hoyt, attorney at Salem, Oregon-based law firm Garrett Hemann Robertson, and Dana Johnson, president and chief investment officer at single-family office MidAmerica Capital Partners, are VALT’s additional proposed directors. The OCC declined to comment on the application, and the FDIC did not respond immediately to a request for comment. But the heads of both agencies have recently spoken in favor of increased de novo chartering. Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gouldtold Banking Dive last monththat one of his major goals while at the helm of the OCC is “invigorating de novo chartering in America.” Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hillnoted earlier this year that new bank formationhas “fallen off a cliff” in recent years. At the American Bankers Association’s Washington Summit in April, he noted that 412 new banks were formed in 1984 alone, and that the lowest number of new banks established in any year between 1995 and 2007 was 93. By comparison, just 86 new banks have been formed since 2010, Hill said, and more than half of them came between 2019 and 2022 when Trump appointee Jelena McWilliams ran the FDIC. The OCC and the FDIC have received a number of bank applications since President Donald Trump took office again in January. Applicants includingCoinbaseandStripe-owned Bridgeseek national trust charters, which do not allow for lending or taking insured deposits. One bank – Erebor Bank, which applied for a de novo charter in June – has received conditional approval under Gould’s leadership. Its conditional approval wasgranted in October. TheOCC leasing manualindicates that the agency should make decisions on a charter application within 120 days of receiving it, lining VALT up for an answer by mid-March. Gediman, for VALT’s part, said the team’s intention is to “build a safe, well-governed institution that meets the needs of modern business owners through a unique digital-first experience.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/valt-bank-applies-for-de-novo-charter/806295/,,
CFPB can’t ignore judge’s order: workers union,"Lawyers for a workers unionurged a federal courtSunday to clarify apreliminary injunctionto ensure that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau leaders don’t shutter the agency by refusing funding. “The defendants have filed a ‘notice’ announcing that they intend to allow the Bureau to run out of funding, and when it does, they will stop complying with the Court’s injunction,” attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union wrote Sunday. “Parties may not simply declare that an injunction no longer applies.” The CFPB this monthalertedthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it “anticipates exhausting its currently available funds in early 2026.” At issue is the definition of “combined earnings.” The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel sent a memo to CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought on Nov. 7, asserting that it interprets earnings – from which the Federal Reserve derives the CFPB’s operating budget – as profit rather than revenue. By that math, the Fed has operated at a loss since 2022. NTEU attorneys asserted Sunday that the Fed earns “billions of dollars a year – from interest on loans and securities, and fees assessed” on banks. But because the Fed has raised interest rates since 2022, its combined interest expenses have exceeded combined earnings. The plaintiffs cite congressional testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told lawmakers the central bank examined that balance “very carefully” and concluded the law is “very clear” that the Fed must fund the CFPB even when its expenses exceed its earnings. Further, NTEU attorneys said, the OLC memo “admits, nobody – not any court, not the Fed, and not the CFPB – has ever interpreted” combined earnings as it suggested this month. “Both the Fed and the CFPB (until Vought needed a mechanism to circumvent this Court’s injunction) have consistently understood ‘combined earnings’ to mean, simply, everything the Fed earns,” NTEU attorneys wrote. The OLC’s interpretation relies on “technical definitions from corporate accounting,” NTEU attorneys wrote. “But the Fed is not a private corporation. It sets monetary policy for the United States. … The only reason to adopt its reading of ‘combined earnings’ is to shut down the CFPB.” Vought, in an appearance last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” indeed said of the CFPB: “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within thenext two, three months.” The bureau last week indicated it istransferring all of its active litigationto the DOJ. By the OLC’s logic, NTEU attorneys wrote, Congress would have passed a Dodd-Frank Act “that forces the Federal Reserve Board to choose between increasing interest rates to combat inflation and funding the CFPB.” “Fortunately, that is not the law that Congress wrote,” the attorneys asserted, blasting the CFPB for not choosing another path. “Rather than asking this Court to modify its injunction (which would require them to demonstrate that it should), the defendants have chosen to just ‘inform’ the Court that they ‘do not understand’ the injunction to bind them once the CFPB runs out of money – even if that’s because they decided not to ask the Fed for funding,” NTEU attorneys wrote. Outside of the courtroom, the CFPB on Friday issued what it termed a “humility pledge” meant to be read aloud by bank examiners to banks before exams. The statement drills down on the bureau’snarrowing of focustoward consumer threats that harm service members, veterans and their families and reiterates that the bureau will “avoid, where possible, duplication of supervision, where States or other regulators are already doing that job.” The bureau pledges shorter examination times – reduced from eight weeks to a period “commensurate with the defined scope of exams.” “No longer will the Bureau ask for expansive data sets or other information which may seem unrelated to the exam or include information inconsistent with Bureau priorities,” the pledge reads. “Any follow-up requests by examiners will first be discussed with an entity and will be tailored to the scope of the exam and the information already received from the entity.” The CFPB states its goal as “[to] work collaboratively with the entities to review entities’ processes for compliance and/or remedy existing problems,” emphasizing self-reporting and encouraging banks to resolve issues with the CFPB’s supervision unit, rather than enforcement. That may lend credence to a narrative, from an all-hands meeting of enforcement staff, in which the bureau’s acting enforcement chief said all 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation at the end of the year. Curiously, perhaps, the pledge encourages banks, if they find their exam experience to be “inconsistent with these principles,” to reach out via email to a designated CFPB supervisory official or the bureau’s chief legal officer. In apost Monday on the NTEU’s website, union member Alexis Goldstein asked, “Why is Russell Vought showing the world his weird, creepy pledge of allegiance to big corporations?” Another union member, Doug Wilson, notes a passage in the pledge in which the bureau asserts that examiners will be “encouraged and incentivized to complete the work promptly and under budget.” “This memo doesn't add up,” Wilson wrote. “Vought’s stopped all supervision exams in 2025, refuses to fund CFPB and says he’s shutting us down by 2026. So how will we supervise banks in 2026 if CFPB is closed? How can bank exams be ‘under budget’ if there is no budget?” In an emailed press release to accompany the humility pledge, the CFPB characterized the bureau’s Biden-era supervision efforts as “thuggery,” calling out ex-supervision chief LoreleiSalas as “a former [Democratic donor George] Soros activist who wasput on leave in February 2025.” Further, bureau leadership labeled the pre-Trump supervision unit as “a weaponized arm of the CFPB.” In aLinkedIn post, Allison Preiss, who until February served as senior adviser to the CFPB director, said the humility pledge “might be better characterized as a humiliation pledge.” “The notion that federal employees should genuflect, trembling, before a Wells Fargo or Bank of America, is some of the most ridiculous nonsense I've read all week,” she wrote. In anotherLinkedIn post, Tyler Creighton, counsel at the CFPB, took issue with the idea that the bureau is calling out examiners’ past conduct. “Supervision's workers have always conducted examinations professionally, efficiently, conscientiously, and with a focus on remedying consumer harm,” he wrote. “We will continue to do so, just as soon as Donald Trump and Russell Vought end the nearly 10-month suspension of examinations and let us get back to work for the American people.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-humility-pledge-supervision-enforcement-bank-examiners-fed-funding-refuse-vought-court/806314/,,
Stripe faces bank charter pushback,"A national trust banking charter would let the digital payments giant Stripe offer banking services while sidestepping certain regulations, an advocacy organization opposingthe payment provider's charter applicationargued in a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency this month. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition alsosaid in the letterthat the charter would give Stripe legitimacy that it does not deserve, pointing to the fintech’s history of legal trouble. Stripe, whichacquired a stablecoin infrastructure companycalled Bridge this year, proposes to name the bank Bridge National Trust. “The OCC must reject Stripe’s application for a national trust bank charter due to serious concerns regarding Stripe’s disregard for enforcement, governance, compliance, and consumer protection laws,” according to the Nov. 13 letter, which is addressed to Sebastian Astrada, the agency’s director for licensing of novel banks. The NCRC is a coalition of hundreds of U.S. community-based organizations which run the gamut from faith-based nonprofits to social justice advocates. The organization posted the letter on its website last week. Bridgeapplied for the charter in October. The charter would give Bridge and its parent company the right to provide custody, stablecoin issuance, and management of stablecoin reserves within a federal framework, rather than through state-to-state money transmitter licenses. Spokespeople for Stripe did not respond to messages seeking comment about the NCRC’s letter. If the charter is approved, Bridge would form the Bridge National Trust Bank, to be headquartered in New York City, according tothe Oct. 14 application. CEO Patrick Collison co-founded Stripe along with his brother John Collison, who is president of the business. “We’ve long believed stablecoins will be a core, regulated building block,” Bridge co-founder Zach Abrams wroteon the social media platform Xlast month. “This regulatory infrastructure will enable us to tokenize trillions of dollars and make this future possible.” The crypto firmsCircle,Paxos,RippleandCoinbasehave also applied for charters through the OCC, although none of those applications has been approved yet. With the trust, Stripe could also facilitate payments without supervision from the Federal Reserve, the NCRC said in its letter. “Granting these firms limited purpose trust charters would blur the statutory boundaries of what constitutes a bank, undermine the credibility of the national charter, and heighten systemic risk by allowing them to operate under a lighter regulatory regime,” the group wrote. The coalition also outlines some of the lawsuits and legal action taken against Stripe. In 2020, for example, the Massachusetts attorney general found Stripe had facilitated payments for a fraudulent cryptocurrency operation due to subpar risk monitoring and fraud prevention systems. The companyagreed to pay $120,000and improve its fraud control and employee training. The letter also lists several lawsuits against the company alleging, among other things, that Stripe failed to ensure customer privacy and protect customer data.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/stripe-faces-bank-charter-pushback/806315/,,
How the open banking rule skidded,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said this month it cannot draw funding to continue operations when its current funds lapse, presenting the agency a number of challenges in formulating an open banking rule quickly. The CFPBtold a federal courtNov. 11 that the Justice Department had concluded that the bureau cannot “lawfully draw funds” from the Federal Reserve System – which Congress designated as its funding source – and that the agency has funds to operate until year’s end. The bureau’s notice did not specify what would happen then, although the CFPB’s acting director, Russ Vought, has assailed the agency in the past and spoke publicly in October about itsclosure within months. The bureau has been working on a new open banking rule since July, when it told a federal court it would “substantially”revise the ruleand was granted a litigation stay of a lawsuitfiled last yearby banking trade groups. The CFPB did not respond to an email Monday seeking comment on the rule. Last week, the bureau notified employees that it wouldtransfer its litigation workto the DOJ and planned additional furloughs at year’s end. In its motion for a stay, the bureau told U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves it planned “an accelerated rulemaking process” to address what it considered to be deficiencies with the prior rule, enacted under the Biden administration. But any proposed rule with significant changes – such as allowing financial institutions to charge fees for access to customers’ data – would also require the bureau to assess the impacts to small businesses under the federal Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, attorneys noted. At that point, a public comment period on the proposed rule – typically 30 to 90 days – would begin. The CFPB would then consider those comments and issue a final rule. However, the bureau is considering skipping some parts of the rulemaking process to issue a rule by year’s end, potentially including a public comment period on its proposed rule,Bloomberg Law reportedThursday, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. “Given the polarized view of these rules by the banking and FinTech sectors, if either constituency objects to the substance of the CFPB’s revisions, additional litigation could ensue,” an attorney with law firm McGlinchey Stafford, Adam Maarec, wrote in a Septemberalertabout the process. “An ‘accelerated rulemaking’ still takes a long time,” added Maarec, who advises fintechs and banks. The prior rule took CFPB staff four years from the rulemaking notice to a final rule, he noted, adding “the scope of issues here seems significantly narrower.” Banking groups that sued the bureau last year leaned heavily on the Administrative Procedure Act for their complaint, arguing that the agency had overstepped its authority to impose “a complicated, costly, and fundamentally insecure mandatory data-sharing framework” that did not allow banks to recover their costs. Last month, Reeves issued apreliminary injunctionpreventing the bureau from enforcing its rule, pending the revised rule the CFPB is formulating. A spokesperson for the Bank Policy Institute said Monday the organization understands that the bureau’s rulemaking process is moving forward but declined to comment further, directing other queries to the agency. The Financial Data and Technology Association, which counts data aggregators Plaid and Yodlee as members, said it continues to oppose any effort allowing banks to impose fees for customer data. Both Plaid and Yodlee have announced agreements with the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase, in the past two months that include new fees for data access. The Dodd-Frank Act does not permit fees, which are “a competitive toll on consumers simply for exercising their right to access and share their own financial information,” FDATA Executive Director Steve Boms said Monday in an emailed statement. “If banks are given the green light to impose those fees in a new rule, it would fundamentally shift control of financial data away from consumers and toward already powerful incumbents.” A spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association declined to comment Friday on the CFPB’s future or rule process, as did the American Fintech Council on Monday. Vought, who also leads the Office of Management and Budget, has been trying todramatically downsizethe CFPB’s workforce and mission since he was appointed acting director in February. “We don’t have anyone working there except our Republican appointees and a few career [employees] that are doing statutory responsibilities while weclose down the agency,” Vought said last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months.” Conservative lawmakers and interest groups have targeted the bureau since Congress formed it 15 years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. “The CFPB is a highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency. It is unconstitutional,” the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote in its “Project 2025Mandate for Leadership” document, in a chapter written by Robert Bowes, ahousing department officialin the first Trump administration and a former Chase Manhattan banking executive. “The next conservative President should order the immediate dissolution of the agency — pull down its prior rules, regulations and guidance, return its staff to their prior agencies and its building to the General Services Administration.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-open-banking-rule-skidded-fintechs-banks-vought-court/806436/,,
Ex-Truist employee sentenced in ‘complex’ check-cashing scheme,"A former Truist branch employee is one of eight Georgia residents sentenced in a counterfeit check-cashing scheme that involved stolen check information, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgiasaid Wednesday. The “complex” check-cashing and kickback scheme ran from at least November 2021 to December 2022, prosecutors said. At the time, Mariarlene Brown, aka “Mati Mom,” 44, of Valdosta, worked at a Truist branch in that city. In conspiring with Brown and others to commit bank fraud, William Allen Roberts, 27, of Valdosta, unlawfully obtained check information from Vincent Galliard, 41, of Sumter, South Carolina. Galliard was a former U.S. Postal Service employee in South Carolina who sold checks he stole from the mail, prosecutors said. Roberts used the check information provided by Galliard to produce fraudulent checks. Six others involved in the scheme recruited people to open Truist bank accounts and then got those people to provide their new Truist debit card and account information to those behind the scheme, “with the understanding that they would be paid for doing so,” prosecutors said. That group of co-conspirators included Frederick Pernell Green, 27; Thomas Christopher Mitchell, 31; Calvin Dewayne McKeithen, aka “Supa,” 26; Dewayne Rasheen Butler, aka “Guwapo,” 26; Tyler Khershad Jones, aka “LA Clippers,” 24; and Davontay Wiseman, aka “Vonn,” 28. Those six then passed the account information on to Roberts, who would write checks to those individuals in various amounts. Roberts, with Brown’s help, deposited checks into those accounts, and Brown made sure Roberts could withdraw cash from the accounts, according to prosecutors. Roberts paid Brown for her help in the scheme, as well as the co-conspirators and account holders, prosecutors said. Green, Roberts, Mitchell, McKeithen, Jones, Butler and Wiseman kept most of each check that was deposited, prosecutors said. Text messages the group members exchanged described the conspiracy, and investigators also discovered photos of debit cards, account numbers, fraudulent checks, cash obtained from the check deposits “and a custom-made diamond ring in the shape of the Truist logo worn by Green,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Brown was sentenced to 33 months in prison, five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $390,475.84 in restitution to Truist on Oct. 9, after she pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Seven others – all except Galliard – also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, were sentenced to prison time and ordered to pay Truist restitution in the same amount. Galliard pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a South Carolina case and was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison, along with five years of supervised release, prosecutors said. Galliard was ordered to pay $149,692.14 in restitution divided among The Citizens Bank, First Citizens Bank, South Atlantic Bank, TD Bank, The Conway National Bank and Bank of America, according toa court filing. “Individuals who participate in check-cashing and kickback schemes will face imprisonment and other penalties,” U.S. Attorney Will Keyes said in the press release. “Investigators from the Secret Service and the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office worked to unravel this criminal network, ultimately preventing further theft and helping us ensure accountability for the defendants.” Bank regulators seek to bolster their efforts to address check fraud, which has grown “substantially” in the past several years, Michelle Bowman, the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision,said in June. Although check use has dropped, check fraud hasn’t diminished in tandem. “Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of real or attempted check fraud transactions grew nearly fourfold, even as the number of checks paid fell by more than 18 percent from 2018 to 2021,”the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantareported this year.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ex-truist-employee-sentenced-check-cashing-scheme/806169/,,
Citi CFO Mark Mason to step down in March,"Citi CFO Mark Mason, arguably the highest-profile Black executive at a U.S.-based global systemically important financial institution, will step down from his role in early March, the bankannounced Thursday. At that point, Gonzalo Luchetti, now the bank’s head of U.S. personal banking, will become CFO. Mason, meanwhile, will transition to executive vice chair and senior executive adviser to Citi CEO Jane Fraser, but he intends to pursue leadership opportunities outside the bank by the end of 2026, according to the announcement. In his adviser role, Mason will help Citi prepare for its investor day May 7 and give guidance on the bank’s strategic initiatives. Mason has been a key figure in Citi’stwo-year reorganization, in which the bank set out to simplify its structure,trim its headcount by 20,000employees by 2026, and embrace tech modernization meant to free it fromtwo 2020 consent orders. Citi launched further reorganization Thursday, saying it would integrate its retail bank into its wealth business. The move arguably hands more responsibility to wealth chief Andy Sieg. The bank’s U.S. Everyday Banking, Citi Priority, Citigold and Citigold Private Client labels will be consolidated into a single group led by Kate Luft. Luft, who has served as head of U.S. retail bankingsince April, will add “and Citigold” to her title and report to Sieg. With the move, “U.S. Personal Banking” will no longer be one of Citi’s five core businesses, the company said. But it will be replaced by “U.S. Consumer Cards,” which will combine the bank’s branded cards and retail services businesses under Pam Habner. Habner, who has served as Citi’s head of branded cards and lendingsince 2020, will join the bank’s executive management team and report directly to Fraser. “This evolution of our leadership team and structure is well timed as it puts in place our next generation of leaders ahead of our upcoming Investor Day, when we will lay out our plans to further grow our returns,” Fraser said Thursday in a statement. “We are ending the year with momentum and confidence.” Mason’s upcoming transition comes less than a month after Citi threw added support behind Fraser,naming her chairand giving her a $25 million equity award meant to keep her in place for years to come. Fraser on Thursday called Mason “an invaluable partner” who “models integrity, drive and commitment no matter the circumstances, and has always put the firm first.” “Mark has proven himself to be a leader for all seasons, having helped Citi navigate some of our most challenging times and being a driving force behind the results we are now seeing in our performance and our Transformation,” Fraser said, citing the capitalized term the bank gives its tech modernization. Mason joined Citi in 2001 and has been CFO since 2019 – but between those benchmarks has served as CEO of Citi’s private bank, CEO of Citi Holdings, and CFO of the bank’s Institutional Clients Group, according to hisLinkedIn profile. “Serving as CFO for the last seven years and contributing to a leadership team that is redefining expectations for Citi stands as one of the most demanding and fulfilling chapters of my career,” Mason said in a statement Thursday. “I know that Gonzalo will work tirelessly with the strong team we’ve built across Finance to further Citi’s momentum, and I am fully committed to his smooth transition into the new role.” Scott Siefers, a managing director and senior research analyst for Piper Sandler, called Mason’s departure “an unfortunate loss” for Citi. “Thankfully, he will be succeeded by an insider with deep experience,” Siefers wrote in a note seen by Banking Dive. Luchetti joined Citi in 2006 and has served, among other roles, as consumer banking chief for Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and as global head of wealth management and insurance, according to hisLinkedIn profile. He became head of U.S. personal banking in 2021 and on Thursday earned plaudits from Fraser for expanding his segment’s return on tangible common equity to 14.5% for 2025’s third quarter. “I knew exactly what we needed in our next CFO to build on Mark’s successful tenure,” Fraser said. “In addition to the table-stakes requirement of superb financial acumen, it must be someone who is strategically minded, data-driven, analytical, and an excellent operator. … Gonzalo is that person.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-mark-mason-cfo-step-down-march-gonzalo-luchetti-fraser-sieg-luft-habner/806137/,,
Wells Fargo taps Saul Van Beurden to scale AI,"Saul Van Beurden, chief executive of Wells Fargo consumer and small business banking,has been tappedto scale artificial intelligence at the bank, the lender said Thursday. Additionally, the bank’s CEO for consumer lending, Kleber Santos, will take on added responsibilities as co-CEO of consumer lending and banking as Wells formally combines the businesses, allowing Van Beurden to focus more on AI. “Generative and agentic AI will reshape competitive dynamics across every industry, and we are embracing these tools as we have embraced robotic process automation and machine learning for years,” Wells CEO Charlie Scharf said in a prepared statement. In August, Wells gave branch bankers, investment bankers, customer relations and corporate teamsaccess to AI agents and toolsfrom Google Cloud. The tools help employees sort through massive loads of documentation and provide real-time market insights, among other things. Wells is among banks in a near-ubiquitous industry pushtoward AI-fueled efficiencies. Wells has trained some 90,000 employees on AI this year, deployed AI tools to many others and is now broadening its uses, Scharf said. “Our employees and customers have powerful models in their hands. They expect the same at work,” Van Beurden toldForbesthis month on AI. “GenAI helps remove simple repetitive tasks, builds workflows and frees people to do higher-value work. We are scratching the surface.” The key is to deploy AI in ways that “enhance human performance rather than replace it,” he told Forbes. In his enhanced role, Van Beurden will help leaders in Wells’ businesses oversee transformation in their own segments, Scharf said in a prepared statement. “Success will be driven by business heads embracing these new technologies and rethinking their own operating models using generative and agentic AI solutions,” Scharf said. The advances in AI, he added, “have given us a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform how we work and we are excited by what we can deliver for our employees, customers and communities.” Van Beurden joined Wells in2019 from JPMorgan Chase, where he was chief information officer of consumer and community banking. The San Francisco-based bankelevated him in 2023from head of technology to CEO of consumer and small-business banking.

CFPB is transferring its cases to DOJ,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is transferring all of its active litigation to the Justice Department, according to separate statements Thursday from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, and the workers union representing the agency. Further, Mike Salemi, the CFPB’s acting enforcement chief, said at an all-hands meeting Thursday that, as he understood it, all bureau employees would be furloughed at the end of the year,Government Executivereported, citing people familiar with the matter. Salemi hedged, saying he was not privy to all of the plans, but that the information came from an associate general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget who also serves as a senior legal adviser at the CFPB. The timeline, if true, would dovetail with a projection CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought made in a podcast appearance last month, when he said the only employees left at the bureau were “our Republican appointees and a few career [staff] that are doing statutory responsibilities while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the nexttwo, three months,” Vought said. Further, DOJ attorneys filed paperwork last week with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, indicating the CFPB “anticipates exhaustingits currently available funds in early 2026.” The filing was meant to flag a “potential lapse in appropriations” to pay the bureau’s operating expenses. The court this year granted apreliminary injunctionpreventing the CFPB from firing the vast majority of its staff. Included in the filing was a memo the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel sent Vought, asserting that the bureau may not legally request funds at this time from the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. Salemi on Thursday said the 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation, according to Government Executive. A few top officials may have the opportunity to work for DOJ,American Bankerreported, citing people who were part of the all-hands call. Salemi noted that the DOJ stood up an enforcement and affirmative litigation unit within its Civil Division in September. Salemi told CFPB staff he assumed the agency’s work would be routed there beginning in 2026, according to Government Executive. Cat Farman, president of the National Treasury Employees Union 335, which represents CFPB employees, said Vought has “no legal authority” to transfer the bureau’s cases to the DOJ. “This is Russ Vought’s latest illegal power grab in his ongoing plan to shut down the CFPB,” Farman said in a statement on theNTEU’s website. However, the Dodd-Frank Act indicates the DOJ has the authority to handle cases where no agency is designated to do so by law,Bloomberg Lawreported. Before the CFPB was established in 2011, the DOJ took cases under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act because no other agency had the power. The CFPB is still litigating 13 cases, Farman said, though Vought this year has dismissed 22 enforcement actions brought by the bureau under previous administrations. “CFPB attorneys are afraid DOJ will dismiss [the remaining] cases,” Farman said. The DOJ declined to comment. The CFPB didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Warren, the senator credited as the architect of the bureau, appeared to hold tight to her suspicions. “Donald Trump and Russ Vought are racing to shut down the CFPB while their lawyers tell the courts the opposite,”Warren wrotein a statement Thursday. “Nobody is fooled about the Trump-Vought end game, and the courts must uphold the law.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-transfer-litigation-doj-enforcement-furloughs-salemi-vought/806193/,,
"TD illegally targeted, fired Chinese-heritage employees: lawsuit","Five former TD Bank employees of Chinese heritage say the bank illegally fired them in the wake of TD’s fentanyl-tied money laundering scandal,court documents show. Plaintiffs Andrew Wong, Ka Po Wong, Anne Louie, April Ng and Millie Su allege that TD “intentionally targeted and disproportionately impacted the bank’s Chinese and Chinese American employees” to placate investigators as they probed the lender’santi-money laundering control issues, and to “give the appearance of robust AML procedures.” The bank’s “robust enforcement” went “far beyond the normal scope” in investigating the employees’ personal transaction histories, particularly cash exchanges that moved through their bank accounts, the plaintiffs said. Chinese families traditionally borrow money from family and friends, rather than banks, and it’s common for family members to gift funds for large purchases, such as a house, plaintiffs said, citing a “financial culture [that] is prevalent in the Chinese diaspora, including the Chinese-American community.” The investigators did not take that into account, the plaintiffs asserted. In one instance, investigators pressed Ng on a $500 transaction in new bills meant as a gift during Chinese New Year, a custom. In another, investigators questioned Su about $15,000 in cash she received from family members. The funds, intended as a house down payment gift to a family associate, were deposited into Su’s account. She added $5,000 from her account, and wrote the associate a $20,000 check. “The targeted Chinese and Chinese American employees provided proof that transactions questioned by TD were legitimate, yet each still suffered the most severe adverse employment action possible. They were terminated,” plaintiffs allege. “More callously, the terminated Chinese and Chinese American were demarketed from TD Bank. TD closed their personal and business accounts, and, upon information and belief, barred them from banking with TD in the future.” Prior to the fentanyl-tied AML investigation, TD “leveraged the national origin of its Chinese and Chinese American employees to foster trust in the Chinese community and build their business,” plaintiffs said. During the investigation, however, TD’s Chinese and Chinese American employees “were then targeted by the bank because of their ethnicity and national origin. They were punished for crimes committed by other Chinese individuals — crimes they were not involved in by individuals they did not know.” “Their Chinese heritage, once used by TD Bank to garner trust in the Chinese community, now became a target for TD,” plaintiffs said. Due to TD’s investigations of its Chinese and Chinese American employees in the New York City’s Chinatown branches alone, at least 22 employees were terminated or subject to adverse employment actions, the lawsuit asserted. All but one of the terminated employees were of Chinese origin. At least one employee was terminated for a transaction with a Chinese American employee, according to court documents. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement at their respective jobs, back pay and emotional damages sustained as a result of TD’s conduct. A TD spokesperson told Banking Dive that the bank has no comment, given that the litigation is pending. Arthur Schwartz, an attorney for the plaintiffs, did not respond to a request for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/td-illegally-targeted-fired-chinese-heritage-employees-lawsuit/806066/,,

Capital One joins FedNow,"Capital One joined the Federal Reserve’s instant payments system FedNow this week, leaving Bank of America and Truist among the major U.S. financial institutions not participating in that real-time ecosystem. Capital One started its FedNow participation Tuesday, a spokesperson for the bank said by email. “Financial Institutions of all sizes are rapidly enabling instant payments for their accountholders,” U.S. Faster Payments Council CEO Reed Luhtanen said by email, when asked for comment on how the system is developing. “The ability to offer instant money movement is becoming table stakes in our 21st century economy, and financial institutions that don’t have a faster payments strategy need to develop one, and fast.” A spokesperson for Bank of America didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson confirmed late last month that the bank had not yet joined FedNow. FedNow has attracted all but two of theeight biggest U.S. retail banks, according to a list of participants on theFederal Reserve’s FedNow website. The service allows for the transfer of payments between banks in seconds or minutes, as opposed to some alternatives that take days. While about 1,550 U.S. financial institutions have joined the FedNow system since itlaunched in July 2023, there are thousands that have not, despite the central bank’s efforts to attract smaller banks as well. In all, there are about 9,000 U.S. financial institutions, including large banks, smaller regional and community banks, and credit unions. (Only U.S. financial institutions are allowed to connect to the FedNow system.) Nonetheless, the large banks are the most active in the payments sphere. The 50 biggest banks operating in the U.S. account for more than 90% of payment originations on the major clearing systems operated by The Clearing House andNacha, based on those organizations’ statistics. To smooth the way to joining the system, the Fed is trying to make it as easy as possible. Currently, the “record” time period for onboarding a bank — from signing a contract with the central bank to offering services — is seven days, FedNow Chief Executive Nick Stanescusaid in a video poston FedNow’s website Tuesday. He noted there are also 41 certified service providers that aid in bringing bank clients to the system. To boost transaction volume, FedNow has been gradually increasing the maximum amount that can be sent over the system.

Lloyds to buy UK fintech Curve,"London-based Lloyds Bank will buy theU.K. fintech Curve, the bankannounced Wednesday. Lloyds did not disclose the price point for the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2026. But the acquisition lends credence to aSky Newsreport from last week, indicating the bank would pay £120 million for the digital wallet provider. That’s less than half the £250 million in funding Curve is said to have raised since its founding in 2015. And it’s far below the valuation CEO Shachar Bialick had targeted for the company. “In ten years’ time we are going to be IPO-ed … and hopefully worth around $50 billion to $60 billion,” Bialick, a former Israeli special forces soldier, toldThe Times of Londonin 2019, using the acronym for initial public offering. In a circular to investors last week, Curve said it “share[s] the disappointment some of you may have in this outcome.” “We recognize that the value of this transaction falls short of the ambitions we all held for Curve,” the company said in the note, seen by Sky News. “Yet, the board strongly believes this transaction represents the best available path forward for Curve's creditors and shareholders as a whole."" However, IDC Ventures, an investor that holds a 12% stake in Curve, said in a statement Friday it is ""deeply concerned about the conduct of Curve's management and board during the current sale process."" IDC alleged a small group of directors and investors at Curve “facilitated corporate decision-making to entrench control and override shareholder rights,” adding that “issues regarding [Curve’s] governance and ownership are disputed.” The investor sought toremove Curve's chairin September, but the effort failed. IDC has consistently opposed a sale to Lloyds since rumors of a potential transaction became public in July. The investor wrote “repeatedly” to Curve and its board, opposing the sale, “without receiving any meaningful response or engagement,” it asserted in September. IDC also said it wrote to Lloyds, but the bank did not respond. “It is a matter of real surprise to shareholders that Lloyds Banking Group, a leading UK institution, would contemplate proceeding with a transaction that IDC believes is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders,” IDC wrote Friday, adding it “does not believe” a sale could be “implemented” without the investor’s support. Curve’s auditors earlier this year had warned of “material uncertainty” at the firm, according toCityAM. Financial figures published in March revealed the company had paused its plans to expand to the U.S. and, in 2023, cut about a third of its workforce, according totech.eu. Curve reported a pretax loss of £36 million in 2023, up from £69 million the year before. Bialick, when asked if Curve would be profitable in 2024, said the company’s “priority is sustainable expansion, and we anticipate reaching break-even in the near term.” Curve touts a digital wallet platform that brings all of a user’s cards and alternative payment sources into one place, while offering payment flexibility, real-time spend insights and no foreign exchange fees. In a statement onCurve’s blog Wednesday, Bialick said Curve’s “mission” has always been to “simplify and supercharge people’s finances.” “Joining forces with Lloyds Banking Group means we can now scale that vision faster, helping tens of millions more customers unlock smarter payments, and empower greater financial accessibility,” he said. Curve, on its own, counts 6 million customers. Lloyds, by comparison, reaches 28 million. The bank announced in January it planned toclose 136 branchesin the U.K. as customers rely more heavily on digital banking. Buying a digital wallet platform, presumably, would dovetail with that vision. “Building on the innovative changes we’ve made to our app recently, integrating Curve’s cutting-edge technology and digital wallet capabilities will deliver a next-generation digital banking experience for our customers as we help them to take control of their finances in a simple and convenient way,” Jas Singh, CEO of consumer relationships at Lloyds, said in a release Wednesday. Lloyds said Wednesday the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the bank, or to affect full-year guidance for 2025 or 2026.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/lloyds-bank-uk-acquire-fintech-curve-digital-wallet-120-million-idc-investor-concern/806065/,,
NY AG’s office scrutinizes SoLo Funds,"Fintech lender SoLo Funds is engaged with the New York attorney general’s office related to usury concerns, an executive said this week. Denzel Singletary, head of government affairs and strategic partnerships at the company, said SoLo Funds was served a subpoena this year by state AG Letitia James’ office. “We're in negotiations with them now, figuring out … what common ground looks like,” Singletary said, speaking Monday at the Banking Transformation Summit in Charlotte, North Carolina, on the topic of fintechs and regulators working together. James’ office declined to comment Tuesday. After SoLo Funds was subpoenaed, “my job initially was to make sure New York knew that we were not working in a nefarious way,” Singletary said. He said he highlighted the fintech’s community platform and tried to dispel misconceptions customers are being charged exorbitant interest rates. SoLo Funds bills itself as a community finance platform. Its business model has drawn the attention of regulators in a handful of states who view its “tip” structure asa predatory lending practice. In recent years, SoLo hasreached agreements with regulatorsin California, Washington, D.C., Connecticut and Pennsylvania related toallegations borrowers were required to pay large “tips” to access loans through its platform. In May 2024,the Los Angeles-based fintech was suedby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau,then under the Biden administration, also took issue with SoLo’s “tip” structure, which it said obscured the total cost of loans. The CFPB also said SoLo, which marketed itself as a consumer-friendly alternative to pricier, short-term loans, hid from borrowers the option to forgo a tip, and offered loans to borrowers in states that require platforms to have a license. SoLo said it had long since changed some components of its display the CFPB called out in the lawsuit. In February, under the Trump administration, the CFPBdropped the lawsuitagainst SoLo Funds. Russ Vought, the CFPB’s acting director who also leads the OMB, said at the time that the bureau under former director Rohit Chopra “shockingly” tried to “destroy” SoLo, “which incurred millions in legal fees and had to lay off 30% of its workforce.” “It was wrong and we dismissed the case,” Vought said. Prior tojoining SoLo Funds in 2024, Singletary was the director of U.S. government affairs at investing fintech Robinhood. “When SoLo Funds reached out to me to come and work with them,” he said, “it was this opportunity of figuring out, how do I make this fintech work well with regulators? What can I do to strengthen this relationship with this particular fintech and regulators?” That task was made far more difficult when, two weeks after he joined SoLo Funds, the firm was sued by the CFPB. He called that “a very interesting intro into the company,” but said he wasn’t deterred in seeking to make sure the regulator and the fintech understood each other. Then came a “blessing” in the form of the presidential administration change in January, Singletary said. “It was an opportunity for us to state our case in front of a new body, really,” he said. In doing that, the fintech focused on its community of users. “What does this whole community look like? What is this application actually doing? Who is it actually helping?” he said. “The customers are always going to make it make sense for the regulators,” he said. “I highlighted the fact that even though there's misconceptions, that we were facing those and actually working through them.” SoLo Funds became the first company to have a lawsuit dismissed by the current CFPB, which has since dropped a number of lawsuits filed under the Biden administration. “I genuinely think that's because we highlighted the community,” Singletary said. “Bodies really matter” when it comes to cooperation between fintechs and regulators. As the CFPB has reversed course on a number of actions, James has been quick to pick up the mantle in New York. Her officesued Capital Oneover lost interest payments to consumers andsued Early Warningover alleged fraud at Zelle – and initiated both after the CFPB dropped similar lawsuits this year. James’ office has also filed lawsuits against earned wage access providersMoneyLion and DailyPay, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to thousands of workers. Travis Holoway and Rodney Williams, the founders of SoLo Funds, soughtto establish an alternative to costly payday lenders, Singletary said. They“were two college-educated men who had made it, and their friends and family were consistently asking them for loans,” Singletary said. SoLo Funds, which launched in 2018, offers checking accounts and debit cards, and through its loan marketplace, members can request loans that other users can fund. The fintech – which taps Bangor Savings Bank for banking services – has about 2 million customers and 1.8 million deposit accounts, and has facilitated about $1 billion in transactions, Singletary said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ny-ag-james-solo-funds-tips-cfpb-fintech-regulators/806024/,,
Senators back open banking rule,"Several Senate Democrats on Thursday called on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to keep pursuing open banking rules that give consumers the ability to easily shift their personal data from one financial institution to another. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut pressed CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought in a letter seen by Payments Dive to continue the federal agency’s work in writing a rule under the Dodd-Frank Act that would further such consumer rights, without fees. The agency issued such a rule last year during the Biden administration, but bank trade groups sued over the regulation and it has been tied up in court. Under Vought’s leadership, the agency stopped backing the Biden-era rule in the litigation, which a judge has stayed, pending the agency’s decision to rewrite the rule. At the same time, Vought is aggressively shrinking the agency and threatening to shutter it, leaving the rule’s future in doubt. “We are concerned that the Trump CFPB’s policymaking seems to be more driven by the seesawing interests of big banks and other industry groups than with protecting consumers’ rights to their own data, as mandated by law,” the senators wrote in their letter. The senators alsoissued a press releaseThursday, insisting Vought reinstate the priorPersonal Financial Data Rights rule. “In the absence of the rule, big banks have demonstrated that they intend to charge exorbitant fees for this data to choke off competition and concentrate this data in the hands of a few large incumbents,” the senators wrote. The senators also contended that banks should not be allowed to charge for access to the data, saying it would be a violation of the law. “Large financial institutions have a monopoly over large swaths of consumer data and thus have the potential to drive out competitors and start ups in the data sharing market,” the letter said. The senators specifically called out JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, for imposing fees this year on third-party data aggregators, including the fintech Plaid. That bank’s fees were “at rates high enough to paralyze the market,” the letter said, noting that PayPal’s peer-to-peer payment tool Venmo and neobank Chime use Plaid to connect users’ bank accounts to their apps. JPMorgan Chase was set to impose an estimated $300 million in new fees annually on Plaid, the senators said, citing an article from Forbes, before the companies reached an agreement in September on terms that weren’t disclosed. JPMorgan Chase’s initial fee structure “indicates where the market may be moving absent the CFPB’s rule,” the letter said. A second data aggregator, Yodlee, this month said it had reached anupdated agreementwith JPMorgan Chase over access fees. The senators argued that “it is critical that any revisions the CFPB makes to the Personal Financial Data Rights rule recognize the importance of consumers being able to exercise their rights, which includes deciding how and by whom their data is used.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/open-banking-cfpb-warren-wyden-blumenthal-vought-jpmorgan-plaid-chime-venmo-yodlee/806190/,,
Florida credit union to buy Georgia bank,"Jacksonville, Florida-based Community First Credit Union of Florida will buy Waycross, Georgia-based First Southern Bank, creating a $3.3 billion-asset institution, thecredit union announced Tuesday. The deal, which would extend the credit union’s footprint into southeast Georgia and elsewhere into Florida, is thesecond CU-bank tie-up announced this week,after El Paso, Texas-based GECU proposed buying Roswell, New Mexico-based Bank of the Southwest on Monday. “While we love the growth opportunities that come with the transaction, this acquisition is founded on a unified vision between Community First and First Southern Bank,” Sam Inman, CEO of Community First, said in a prepared statement. “Both institutions emphasize a community-oriented and relationship-based approach, maintaining a culture that respects individuals and prioritizes service excellence.” Both institutions are storied: Community First is 90 years old. First Southern is 118 years old. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both institutions, is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2026. After that, First Southern’s holding company will liquidate, dissolve and distribute any remaining assets to its stockholders. The new Community First will count roughly $2.5 billion in loans and $2.9 billion in deposits across 31 branches. “First Southern Bank customers will continue to see their trusted familiar banker at each location,” said First Southern CEO Daniel Hager in a prepared statement. “The newly combined institution will have the ability to offer highly personalized financial services, which will enable us the financial capabilities to support further expansion.” Community First plans to retain all First Southern employees, stretching its headcount to 530. “Combining will expand services and strengthen community impact,” Community First said in a Q&A on its website. Tie-ups between credit unions and banks are not without challengers.Independent Community Bankers of America CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey released a statement Tuesday calling for policymakers “to address the harmful impact these deals have on local communities.” CitingICBA data, Rainey said the deals harm “small businesses and local communities while community banks outperform credit unions in high-poverty areas.” She called for Congress to eliminate the federal tax exemption for credit unions with more than $1 billion in assets. More than 80% of deals since 2010 have involved credit unions of that size, ICBA found. Four in 10 deals have involved a credit union headquartered in a different state than the acquired bank. Small Business Administration lending fell almost 80% at community banks that were acquired by credit unions, according to ICBA, and the amount loaned per approved mortgage application at the institutions decreased 61%. Michael Bell, a partner at Honigman who often architects such deals – including this one – told Banking Dive that ICBA’s statements are without “substance.” “The ICBA equates size to evil for some reason,” he said. “I ask the ICBA, is a $1 billion community bank still a community bank? Should all community banks larger than $1 billion give up the many tax subsidies enjoyed by community banks?”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/florida-credit-union-buy-georgia-bank/805897/,,
White House nominates Vought aide to lead CFPB,"Additionally, Geof Gradler was named deputy director of the CFPB. He’s a former lobbyist who joined the bureau about four months ago, according tohis LinkedIn profile. The CFPB spokesperson declined to comment on the fate of the agency, or whether the bureau intended to make a similar move in another 210 days. Vought said last monthon a podcast that onlyRepublican appointees and a few career employees remain “while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months,” Vought said. Trump administration officials have tried repeatedly this yearto hobble or shutterthe agency but have, at times run into court-ordered roadblocks. The CFPB spokesperson said the hearing process likely will be a moot point for Levenbach. The Senate probably wouldn’t get around to it until next year, the spokesperson said, and with Vought not going anywhere, the formal process may not occur. Michael Emancipator, senior vice president and regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America,noted on LinkedInWednesday that Levenbach’s nomination appears to be “merely a resetting of the clock” under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. And McGuireWoods partner Jeff Ehrlich, a former deputy enforcement director at the CFPB, said the nomination is “likely a placeholder,” according toa LinkedIn post. The spokesperson pointed toa news releasethe bureau issued last week, in which the CFPB said itinformed the court inNTEU v. Voughtthat the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the CFPBcan’t legally request fundsfrom the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB “anticipates having sufficient funds to continue operations until at least December 31,” the release said.DOJ attorneys told the court that available funds are expected to run out in early 2026. Levenbach is also vice chair of theNational Capital Planning Commission, a panel that Voughtthreatened to involvein this summer’s dust-up over an over-budget renovation at the Federal Reserve. Levenbach served as chief of staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during Trump’s first term. Later, he became a senior adviser with the White House National Economic Council and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, according tohis LinkedIn profile. Prior to those roles, he spent about a decade at OMB. “Donald Trump’s sending the Senate a new nominee to lead the CFPB looks like nothing more than a front for Russ Vought to stay on as Acting Director indefinitely as he tries to illegally close down the agency,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a Wednesday statement. “Instead of doing everything in their power to lower costs for Americans, Trump and Vought want to make it easier for giant corporations to scam families out of their money.” Consumer Bankers Association CEO Lindsey Johnson said Levenbach’s nomination “comes at a critical time for consumers and the financial services marketplace.” “America’s leading Main Street banks look forward to continuing to work with the Trump Administration on data-driven, pro-growth policies that will support hardworking Americans and drive the economy forward, while at the same time ensuring the Bureau fulfills its statutory mission and sticks to what Congress authorized it to do,” she said in a Wednesday statement. “This will not only help restore the trust and credibility of the CFPB, but will benefit consumers, industry, and the broader economy alike.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-director-levenbach-vought-omb-trump/805913/,,
LevelField gets state approval to buy Chicago bank,"LevelField filed a fresh application to buy Burling inDecember 2024. In that paperwork, the Houston firm said it would pay roughly $70 million for the bank, which counts a single branch and $209.5 million in assets. The combined entity will be renamed LevelField Bank but maintain Burling’s community banking business. However, it will add a focus on deposit accounts, loans and custody services tailored to digital assets, including term loans and credit cards secured by bitcoin or Ether, according to the application. Burling's CEO, Michael Busch, will become president of LevelField Bank, Grant said. From the beginning, LevelField said it sought to become the first full-service chartered bank to offer traditional banking and digital asset services on one platform across the U.S. ""The idea is, once we have a customer, they don't have to go outside the bank perimeter for anything they want to do in digital assets,” Grant told American Banker. Grant said he expects acquisition to be finalized by the end of this year. Only Burling’s cannabis banking business will retain the Burling brand, LevelField said. To accommodate the anticipated round-the clock needs of its digital-asset user base, LevelField aims to hire roughly 100 employees in 2026 – mostly in customer service, Grant said. Once LevelField receives regulatory approval, it aims to raise $112.5 million, according to its December 2024 filing. That is meant to cover the acquisition of the bank, $20 million in growth capital and $17.5 million that LevelField will retain, the company said. In a release Monday, Grant thanked investors “for backing the patient, disciplined work it took to meet the necessary supervisory standards that protect consumers and businesses and make the U.S. the home of the world leading banking system."" As far as embracing crypto, Grant said the banking system can either ""live in denial or we can try to safely integrate it … in such a way that it works collaboratively and doesn't endanger the system."" “Financial services must be changed from the inside, and unlike other industries, outside disruptors barely move the needle,” Granttold Bloomberg.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/levelfield-acquire-burling-bank-illinois-regulator-approval-crypto-digital-asset/805947/,,
FDIC countersues Capital One over special assessment,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. accused Capital One of paying $99.4 million less than necessary to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund following the 2023 failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, according tocourt documents filed Monday. The FDIC’s lawsuit countered legal action takenin Septemberagainst the regulator by the bank, which alleged the FDICimposed an “outsized and improperly calculated” special assessment fee on Capital One. The FDIC inflated its assessment against Capital One by $149.2 million, the bank said in September. At issue is a $56 billion position between two Capital One subsidiaries which, according to Monday’s lawsuit, Capital One excluded in its reporting of uninsured deposits. Capital One said the agency “erroneously” included the position as uninsured deposits, inflating what the bank owed. The FDIC used funds from the DIF to protect uninsured depositors when banks fail. When SVB and Signature Bank were seized by the FDIC in March 2023, most of their deposits – 88% and 67%, respectively – were above the FDIC’s $250,000 threshold and “uninsured.” To recoup DIF funds later that year, the FDIC implemented a special assessment on the nation’s largest banks, including Capital One. The FDIC argued Monday that Capital One benefits from deposit insurance, and that the funds were “deposits held at the bank for which the subsidiary already received the benefit of FDIC deposit insurance.” ""There are no time machines when it comes to special assessments,” the FDIC said. Capital One and the FDIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fdic-countersues-capital-one-over-special-assessment/805937/,,
JPMorgan Chase enhancing due diligence for clients in the Amazon region,"The change itself does not come with any inherent restrictions on client activities or transactions in the region, but a JPMorgan spokesperson told ESG Dive on Wednesday that each activity and transaction will be considered “on a case-by-case basis, in line with [its] risk appetite and commercial interests.” “Managing risk is critical to the long-term success of our business,” the bank’s spokesperson said in emailed comments. “We added Amazon Biome as one example of a business location associated with clients and/or transactions we consider sensitive or in need of enhanced review, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.” The RAISG geospatial definition, which JPMorgan will use to define the biome, “is widely recommended by Indigenous leaders and activists,” according to Stand.earth. Allison Fajans-Turner, a senior campaigner at the Rainforest Action Network — one of the environmental organizations backing the annual Banking on Climate Chaos reports — said requiring enhanced due diligence for activities in the Amazon biome is “the bare minimum that we should expect from other large backers of Amazon drilling.” “JPMorgan Chase has finally taken an essential — if long-overdue — step to confront its role as the largest financier of oil and gas extraction in the Amazon,” Fajans-Turner said in Stand.earth’s Nov. 13 release. After 30% of JPMorgan’s shareholders supported a proposal to require the bank to issue a report on its practices on Indigenous People's rights in the 2024 proxy season, JPMorgan reached an agreement with shareholders proposing a similar filing in the most recent proxy season. The United Church Fundwithdrew its proposal to the bankin April — afterJPMorgan submitted a no-action requeston the filing — once the bank agreed to add a disclosure stating “the company will consider free, prior and informed consent where risks are identified before proceeding with transactions that may have material implications for Indigenous Peoples.” “Promises on paper to respect Indigenous and human rights and screen clients operating in the Amazon biome fall far short of what’s needed: real financing exclusions applied to the Amazon and other fragile ecosystems and rigorous implementation of human rights protections for Indigenous peoples and all affected local communities,” Fajans-Turner said in the Nov. 13 release. In addition to the Arctic and the Amazon, JPMorgan requires a case-by-case enhanced review for coal mining and coal-fired power activities; clients whose “main business is the physical trading of conflict minerals,” cobalt or diamond trading; and hydropower, agricultural commodities or downstream agricultural commodity use in non-designated countries.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-enhancing-due-diligence-amazon-region-clients-standearth/806007/,,
Investor blasts Comerica over Fifth Third deal,"Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management on Monday probed Comerica’s $10.9 billion deal to be acquired by Fifth Third and threatened legal action against the bank if more information on the deal process isn’t released. Additionally, Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions was Comerica’s first suitor, before the Dallas-based bank struck a deal with Fifth Third,American Bankerreported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Spokespeople for Regions and Fifth Third declined to comment. A Comerica spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July,accusing the regional lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” HoldCo, whichowns about 2.04 million shares of Comerica stock,suggested PNC, Fifth Third or Huntington as possible buyers. In October, Fifth Third said it wasacquiring Comerica for $10.9 billionin stock. Earlier this month,a regulatory filingrevealed that the Cincinnati-based lender was not Comerica’s first suitor. The CEO of another bank, identified as Financial Institution A in the filing, proposed an all-stock transaction with $78 billion-asset Comerica in September. But Comerica’s board determined the terms “were not likely to be more attractive than the consideration that could be offered by another counterparty.” HoldCo’s65-page presentation issued Monday, which parsed recent regulatory filings, alleged a lack of board oversight in Comerica CEO Curt Farmer’s interactions with Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence and the absence of a competitive process in the Fifth Third deal, saying “this isn’t negotiation; it’s surrender.” HoldCo accused Comerica’s board of ignoring Financial Institution A’s proposals, a choice it called “indefensible,” and contended “had you engaged, we believe those ‘preliminary’ bids would have matured into definitive proposals — at likely materially higher levels.” HoldCo also critiqued Farmer’s “windfall” – he’s set to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks – and the deal’s “aggressive” breakup fee of $500 million. The acquisition is set to face a shareholder vote in January. HoldCo demanded a raft of details, calling on Comerica to “provide a more complete and transparent chronology of the events leading up to the Fifth Third transaction.” That includes when the board first discussed potential responses to shareholder pressure and when it authorized Comerica management to explore a merger, as well as information on the identity of Financial Institution A, the timing, substance and financial terms of its proposals, and whether Comerica or its advisers engaged with that bank. “The apparent absence of any follow-up engagement with a bidder who made an offer — combined with the lack of evidence that J.P. Morgan sought to create competition between bidders — suggests a process engineered to favor Fifth Third rather than one designed to maximize shareholder value,” the activist investor said. HoldCo also pressed for details on the decision to hire JPMorgan Chase as Comerica’s financial adviser, and seeks more specifics related to Farmer’s conversations with Spence. “The size and timing of Mr. Farmer’s compensation package strongly indicate a potential conflict of interest — namely, that Fifth Third effectively ‘overpaid’ the CEO to secure a lower purchase price for shareholders,” the activist said. If the bank doesn’t provide the requested detail, “we will have to consider seeking expedited relief in the Delaware Court of Chancery to obtain the disclosures we believe are warranted,” HoldCo said. The activist may also consider bringing fiduciary-duty claims in the Delaware court. In recent months, Regions executives have repeatedly expressed disinterest in acquiring a bank, instead eyeing the opportunity to snag customers and talentamid disruption caused by other M&Aactivity. Regions CFO David Turner reiterated those views this month at theBancAnalysts Association of Boston conference– which would have been after the bank reportedly proposed a deal with Comerica. “We're, I think, the only bank that hadn't done an acquisition since 2006,” Turner said Nov. 7. The bank had just finished its strategic plan, “and M&A is not part of that plan,” he said. “It's just not part of where we want to focus our time and attention. And we understand things can change, but that's just not where we are today,” Turner added. Still, one analyst noted some wonder whether the bank’s position may change. “With increased M&A activity in their Southeast backyard, there have been investors who wonder if [Regions management] would start to feel compelled to take part in the M&A wave, particularly since the company is profitable but has had challenges growing organically,” Truist Securities analyst Brian Finneran wrote in a Tuesday note.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/holdco-activist-comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-regions/805807/,,
Revolut valued at $75B,"Revolut is valued at $75 billion after completing a share sale, theBritish fintech said Monday. Revolut did not disclose how many shares were sold or the amount raised. It’s the fifth share sale Revolut has allowed its staff to date, with the fintech asserting it’s “one of the most liquid employee share programmes across private companies in the industry.” The new valuation marks significant growth sinceRevolut’s $45 billion valuation 15 months ago, which came directly after it received its long-awaitedBritish banking license. Since then, Revolut has entered multiple markets,named a chairof its Western Europe arm and finalized itsbanking license in Mexico. It’s also exploring U.S. growth, with Revolut U.S. CEO Sid Jajodia saying in October thatnabbing a stateside charteris part of the firm’s growth “mission.” “The level of investor interest and our new valuation reflect the strength of our business model, which is delivering both rapid growth and strong profitability,” CFO Victor Stinga said in a prepared statement on the recent share sale. “We welcome onboard a series of world-class investors and look forward to working with them for the next stage in Revolut’s evolution.” The transaction was led by Coatue, Greenoaks, Dragoneer and Fidelity Management & Research Company. Nvidia’s venture capital arm NVentures, Andreessen Horowitz, Franklin Templeton and T. Rowe Price Associates also participated. In ablog postMonday, Coatue wrote that it sees Revolut “charting a new path.” “They are building the world’s first global financial super-app, which is now operating in 39 countries and serves over 65 million users,” wrote Brendan O’Boyle, Rohan Bharvani and Lucas Swisher, investors at Coatue, which also led Revolut’s 2024 funding round. “What began as a travel card designed to avoid high [foreign exchange] fees has evolved into a multi-product financial platform that is redefining what modern banking looks like for consumers and businesses.” Revolut’s 2024 revenue grew 72% to $4 billion year over year, with profit before tax more than doubling to $1.4 billion. Its Revolut Business arm hit $1 billion in annualized revenue in 2025, the company said. The new valuation “reflects the remarkable progress we have made in the last twelve months towards our vision of building the first truly global bank, serving 100 million customers across 100 countries,” CEO Nik Storonsky said in a prepared statement.

"Comerica, Fifth Third sued by activist investor","Just days after threatening legal action against Comerica, HoldCo Asset Management has sued the regional bank and its proposed buyer, Fifth Third. The activist investor accused Comerica CEO Curt Farmer of being “focused solely on advancing his own interests” based on the “rushed” way the Dallas-based bank’s proposed$10.9 billion acquisition by Fifth Thirdcame together. Theclass-action complaint, filed Friday in the Delaware Court of Chancery by HoldCo Opportunities Fund, alleges breaches of fiduciary duty by Comerica and its board members related to the transaction and its “draconian” provisions. It also accuses the bank of leaving out material information from disclosures related to the deal. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCo also accused Fifth Third of “aiding-and-abetting” the board in breaching its fiduciary duty. HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July, accusing the lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” In October, Fifth Third announced it would acquire Comerica. HoldCoissued a presentationlast week that picked apart the proposed deal, threatening to take Comerica to court if it didn’t release more information on how the agreement came together. Comerica rebuffed at leastone earlier suitor, Financial Institution A, according to a disclosure. That was Regions Bank, American Banker reported. The deal between Comerica and Fifth Third was “negotiated over an extraordinarily compressed timeline,” HoldCo’s Friday complaint contends. It was driven by Farmer’s “fear of an activist contest” led by HoldCo, “and his fear that no other bidder would keep him on,” the firm alleged. “Fearing for his job, Farmer raced to find a friendly white knight that could provide him with a lucrative post-closing role,” the complaint asserts. Farmer isset to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks. Part of the rush, HoldCo claims, was to avoid any proxy contest at Comerica’s annual meeting, to have been held by May 2026. The Fifth Third deal is projected to close in the first quarter of 2026. Although Comerica received an offer from Financial Institution A, the complaint alleges the Dallas bank decided to “nip those negotiations in the bud” and solely focus on Fifth Third. The deal came together hastily and in a way that ensures “no topping bid could disrupt Farmer’s entrenchment plan,” HoldCo attorneys alleged. The merger agreement carries a “gargantuan” termination fee of $500 million and “an absurdly narrow fiduciary-out” that doesn’t let the board scrap the merger for a higher bid, HoldCo said in the complaint. The “draconian” deal protections mean Comerica’s board couldn’t terminate the acquisition for a better proposal until October 2026, even if shareholders don’t vote in favor of the deal, the filing said. HoldCo also alleges the registration statement is “materially misleading and incomplete” and doesn’t provide shareholders with any details that would allow them to compare the deal’s terms with Financial Institution A’s proposed offers. “There is no evidence from the Registration Statement that Comerica ever made a counterproposal or tried to negotiate for a price above the lowest end of the exchange ratio range in Fifth Third’s initial proposal,” the complaint said. “Nor is there any evidence that Comerica made any attempt to re-engage Financial Institution A (to see if it would provide a better proposal) or solicit interest from other potential bidders.” The 17-day span – from the start of potential merger conversations between Farmer and Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence to when an agreement was signed – “is the shortest timeframe of any of the ten largest bank mergers, with the next shortest taking 43 days and the median taking 67 days,” HoldCo contended. “Such negotiations are more reminiscent of distressed bank sales during the 2008 global financial crisis,” the complaint said. In aresponse filed Monday, attorneys for Comerica argued HoldCo’s views are at odds with those of other bank shareholders, and blasted the activist for “asking this Court to deprive stockholders of a merger after agitating for just such a deal.” Fifth Third’s attorneys, in aseparate Monday filing, called HoldCo’s aiding and abetting assertion a “facially meritless claim.” “This case is only about HoldCo’s self-serving activism goals,” Fifth Third’s attorneys said. Comerica and Fifth Third attorneys accused HoldCo of “gamesmanship” and called its claims weak. Comerica’s lawyers also needled HoldCo for “revel[ing] in its notoriety” after pushing for the bank to sell itself and seeking credit for the outcome. Comerica’s attorneys also noted HoldCo was in communication with the bank’s counsel in the days leading up to filing Friday’s complaint. “At no time during those communications did HoldCo indicate it would be filing a suit to enjoin the deal on Friday afternoon before Thanksgiving week,” Comerica’s attorneys said. The shareholder vote on the acquisition is tentatively scheduled for Jan. 6. A hearing was set to be held Tuesday related to a motion to expedite the case. Spokespeople for Comerica and Fifth Third declined to comment. Attorneys withBernstein Litowitz Berger & Grossman, the law firm representing HoldCo, didn’t return requests for comment. HoldCo also didn’t respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-sued-activist-investor-holdco/806428/,,
Fulton Financial to buy NJ’s Blue Foundry in $243M deal,"Fulton Financial Corp.will acquire Blue Foundry Bancorpin an all-stock transaction valued at $243 million, the companies announced Monday. The transaction, expected to close in the second quarter of 2026, pushes Lancaster, Pennsylvania-based Fulton into northern New Jersey. The bank gained a presence in the southern part of the state last year with itsacquisition of Republic First. The Philadelphia-based bank had locations in New Jersey and New York before it failed. Acquiring $2.15 billion-asset Blue Foundry, headquartered in Rutherford, New Jersey, gives $32 billion-asset Fulton 21 additional branches in eight counties, including four of the state’s most populous. “The expansion in northern New Jersey aligns with our strategy of growing in our local markets and positions us well to drive organic growth across our commercial, consumer, wealth advisory and mortgage businesses,” Fulton CEO Curtis Myers said in a prepared statement. “The combination of our companies creates an opportunity to leverage Fulton’s robust banking services and provide greater convenience and innovative solutions to an expanded customer base, with a continued focus on supporting our local communities,” he said. Under the terms of the agreement, Blue Foundry investors will receive 0.65 shares of Fulton common stock for each share they own. The transaction’s estimated $243 million value stems from Fulton’s $17.96 share price from Friday. “Joining forces with Fulton is an exciting step forward for our employees, customers and communities,” Blue Foundry CEO James Nesci said in a prepared statement. “This partnership allows us to preserve the local relationships and personalized service our customers value, while gaining access to greater resources and providing more solutions and convenience to customers.” In recent years, Blue Foundry has been a publicly traded bank, during which time it has reported more than $20 million in losses,American Bankerreported. Activist investor Larry Seidman, who had pushed for its sale via proxy campaign last year, told American Banker there was “no question whatsoever” that Fulton would be able to produce better results than Blue Foundry has with its assets. “It's a good bank with good management,” Seidman said of Fulton. “Blue Foundry was horrible. They couldn't make any money.” The transaction is expected to be immediately accretive to tangible book value per share. It’s expected to be accretive to first full-year earnings by over 5%, and neutral to regulatory capital ratios at close. As part of the deal, Fulton will make a $1.5 million donation to the Fulton Forward Foundation, which provides impact grants to nonprofit community organizations in New Jersey.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fulton-financial-to-buy-nj-blue-foundry-243m-deal/806443/,,
MoneyLion to pay $1.75M to settle CFPB lawsuit,"MoneyLion agreed Friday topay $1.75 millionto settle a long-running lawsuit from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, alleging the fintech charged more than the maximum 36% interest rate allowed by the Military Lending Act on loans to service members. The settlement narrows – to 12 – the number of cases the CFPB has in active litigation, based on acount given last weekby a representative of the bureau’s workers union. The CFPB has dismissed 22 enforcement actions this year. The case also bolsters the CFPB’s commitment –from April, and subsequently reinforced in a “humility pledge” Friday – to focus on providing redress to service members, veterans and their families. As part of the settlement, MoneyLion is barred from extending consumer credit at rates higher than 36% to borrowers for whom the MLA cap applies. That includes credit insurance premiums or fees, any fee for a debt cancellation contract or debt suspension agreement, or any fee for a credit-related ancillary product sold as part of a credit transaction. It also includes finance charges, application fees or membership fees. That was a focal point of the CFPB’sSeptember 2022 lawsuitagainst the company. MoneyLion required customers to join a membership program – which carried a monthly fee between $19.99 and $29 – to access the fintech’s low annual percentage rate installment loan product, the bureau said when the suit was first filed. But the company failed to allow borrowers to cancel their memberships until their loans were paid, and in some cases, wouldn’t cancel memberships if the borrower had unpaid membership fees, the CFPB added. Friday’s settlement bars MoneyLion from preventing borrowers from canceling their membership. It also does not permit the fintech to engage in collections activities for past unpaid membership fees, collecting membership fees for periods when memberships were suspended. MoneyLion also can’t prevent borrowers from paying off loans in full by using funds in their credit reserve account, according to the settlement. Nor can the company ding borrowers’ credit scores over unpaid membership fees. Also as part of the settlement, MoneyLion must submit an accurate written compliance report, sworn under penalty of perjury, to the CFPB, detailing the number of borrowers who received redress and the amount paid to each. The settlement covers borrowers who had outstanding MoneyLion loans between December 2017 and October 2024. MoneyLion, in September 2022, disputed the CFPB’s allegations, accusing the regulator of taking a “sensationalist route of prioritizing headlines instead of engaging in constructive dialogue.” “MoneyLion has the highest regard for its military and veteran customers and [is] committed to working with this important community to help them achieve better financial health,” the company said at the time. “MoneyLion is honored to serve this important segment of its customer base and is grateful for the sacrifice these men and women have made for our country.” The membership offering represents a small subset of MoneyLion’s business, the company said at the time. Since then, the fintech has come under new management: MoneyLionwas acquired this yearby Gen Digital forabout $1 billion. The CFPB is also not the only entity with a consumer-protection case against MoneyLion.New York’s attorney generalsued MoneyLion and fellow earned wage access provider DailyPay in April, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to tens of thousands of workers with fees that “amount to outrageous annual interest rates in the triple digits.” Thecity of Baltimorelast month sued MoneyLion, alleging the company misled and manipulated consumers into taking out small-dollar, short-term loans that come with high fees. MoneyLion in 2023 persuaded the judge in the CFPB case topause proceedingsahead of aSupreme Court rulingthat affirmed the bureau’s funding structure is constitutional.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-moneylion-settlement-mla-interest-rate-36-cap-military-membership-fees/806439/,,
U.S. Bank hires up for greater Southeast growth,"After adding bankers to serve businesses in Dallas and Houston, U.S. Bank is now focused on further expansion across the Southeast, a business banking executive said. Within the next six months, U.S. Bank plans to hire at least a dozen bankers in a couple of Southeast states where it doesn’t have branches, said Dee O’Dell, head of business banking sales at the Minneapolis-based lender. He didn’t elaborate, butthat group includesAlabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi and South Carolina. The super-regional bank has recently added teams of bankers in markets where it’s seeing greater growth opportunity, including a second team in Charlotte, North Carolina; a second in Las Vegas; and a fourth in Chicago, O’Dell said during a recent interview. In his unit, about 250 people have been hired into new roles this year. In Houston, where the $695 billion-asset bank announced last week it added a business banking team, four people have been hired and the lender plans to bring on two more, he said. In U.S. Bank’s business banking segment, which serves companies generating between $2.5 million to $50 million in annual revenue, about 1,200 employees across the country serve about 75,000 clients, O’Dell said. The consumer and business banking segmentmakes up about 32%of the lender’s overall revenue, which was $21.3 billion year to date,as of Sept. 30. U.S. Bank provides those commercial clients with different types of credit for their capital needs, including conventional financing, owner-occupied real estate loans and Small Business Administration loans. Clients in that size range often “not only have their primary business, but they're looking for ways to diversify,” O’Dell said. “They not only want to own the building they're in, they may want to own some other buildings as well, and so we've got the ability to provide capital for them, not only for their core business, but for investment real estate.” Bankers also seek to connect clients with other U.S. Bank services, such as credit cards, merchant processing, treasury management, foreign exchange and wealth management. Amid a highly competitive landscape, the lender has sharpened efforts to offer anddeliver services to clientsin a comprehensive way, O’Dell said. “Our approach has been to integrate all that together so that there is value that comes from having all of that in one place,” he said. To zero in on where businesses could gain the most benefit, the bank developed – along with a fintech O’Dell wouldn’t name – a proprietary diagnostic tool for companies. The questionnaire assesses business needs and money movement, diagnoses the level of efficiency in those functions and has a team review results with business clients. “The idea is that instead of trying to sell any one of those products, we're approaching it in a much more consultative and holistic way,” O’Dell said. “It helps our clients see how they can be even more efficient, save time in their day, eliminate risk of fraud, other things like that.” That diagnostic effort has bolstered the bank’s success rate in serving new clients since it was introduced nearly two years ago, O’Dell said. “Sometimes our bankers will meet with a company that we don't bank with today. And if your question is, ‘Do you need any banking services?’ The answer might be, ‘No, no, everything's fine. It's all good,’” O’Dell said. “If we can get them to engage with us and have this conversation and fill out this basic template questionnaire, we can go back and provide insights. And often, it opens up a conversation where companies don't even realize the things that they are doing or not doing that could lead to so much greater efficiency.” Another newer internal tool aggregates data to give bankers a view of companies or prospects within the markets they serve, allowing them to sort by sales size, industry type or ownership of property, so they can better target clients based on potential needs, O’Dell said. SBA loans may be a prime option for some of those businesses and that’s an area of lending U.S. Bank seeks to grow further, since it can serve as a company’s entry point into the bank. U.S. Bank has doubled its SBA lending in the past two years, O’Dell said. In fiscal 2025, the bank totaled $871.2 million in SBA 7(a) loans, up 23% from the previous fiscal year,it said last month. “We've been able to use that program to help a number of companies, individuals get capital they wouldn't otherwise be able to get, and because of the way that we approach that, and our client selection in that, the loss ratio that we've had in that space has been very attractive to our shareholders,” O’Dell said. SBA lending can be ideal in some succession situations, O’Dell noted. The segment of businesses O’Dell oversees has a significant number of owners nearing the end of their careers, so the bank also aims to jump on the chance to be involved in those moments. In cases where a business owner doesn’t have a child who wants to take over, they may look to sell to a similar company or private equity firm. Or if there’s someone in the company who’s interested in acquiring it but doesn’t have the capital, the bank can use an SBA loan to help with that pursuit. “We see great opportunities to help the next generation of business owners acquire business and a current generation who are at the end of their careers, exit, monetize what they've invested in, and have this sense that their legacy will continue,” O’Dell said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/us-bank-adding-business-bankers-southeast-odell/806212/,,
VALT Bank applies for de novo charter,"A group of former U.S. Bank executives is seeking federal approval to establish VALT Bank, applications submitted to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. on Nov. 13 show. The proposed bank, headquartered in Eagle, Idaho, will be fully digital and will focus on serving “digitally demanding small to midsized businesses” in the U.S., according to its application. VALT plans to offer credit and deposit products as well as treasury and cash management services, and plans to provide clients with SMB-focused automation solutions. The bank will be led by proposed director, CEO and President Matt Gediman, whose nearly two-decade U.S. Bank career culminated in three years as a managing director in the bank’s private wealth management business. “When we refer to ‘digitally demanding SMBs,’ we mean revenue-generating small and midsized businesses that use technology across their daily operations and expect the same level of technological fluency from their financial service providers,” Gediman told Banking Dive via email Monday. These are traditional businesses, he added – not tech firms or crypto companies. VALT does not plan to interact with digital assets. “Our customers are established SMBs that simply expect modern, reliable, integrated digital banking,” he said. “[O]ur model is designed to support them by making banking uncomplicated, accessible, and integrated with digital tools to run their businesses more efficiently,” he said. Former U.S. Bank Vice Chairman John Elmore is VALT’s proposed executive chair and Ross Carey, former U.S. Bank EVP of business banking and SBA division, is its proposed vice chair. Kim Hoyt, attorney at Salem, Oregon-based law firm Garrett Hemann Robertson, and Dana Johnson, president and chief investment officer at single-family office MidAmerica Capital Partners, are VALT’s additional proposed directors. The OCC declined to comment on the application, and the FDIC did not respond immediately to a request for comment. But the heads of both agencies have recently spoken in favor of increased de novo chartering. Comptroller of the Currency Jonathan Gouldtold Banking Dive last monththat one of his major goals while at the helm of the OCC is “invigorating de novo chartering in America.” Acting FDIC Chair Travis Hillnoted earlier this year that new bank formationhas “fallen off a cliff” in recent years. At the American Bankers Association’s Washington Summit in April, he noted that 412 new banks were formed in 1984 alone, and that the lowest number of new banks established in any year between 1995 and 2007 was 93. By comparison, just 86 new banks have been formed since 2010, Hill said, and more than half of them came between 2019 and 2022 when Trump appointee Jelena McWilliams ran the FDIC. The OCC and the FDIC have received a number of bank applications since President Donald Trump took office again in January. Applicants includingCoinbaseandStripe-owned Bridgeseek national trust charters, which do not allow for lending or taking insured deposits. One bank – Erebor Bank, which applied for a de novo charter in June – has received conditional approval under Gould’s leadership. Its conditional approval wasgranted in October. TheOCC leasing manualindicates that the agency should make decisions on a charter application within 120 days of receiving it, lining VALT up for an answer by mid-March. Gediman, for VALT’s part, said the team’s intention is to “build a safe, well-governed institution that meets the needs of modern business owners through a unique digital-first experience.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/valt-bank-applies-for-de-novo-charter/806295/,,
CFPB can’t ignore judge’s order: workers union,"Lawyers for a workers unionurged a federal courtSunday to clarify apreliminary injunctionto ensure that Consumer Financial Protection Bureau leaders don’t shutter the agency by refusing funding. “The defendants have filed a ‘notice’ announcing that they intend to allow the Bureau to run out of funding, and when it does, they will stop complying with the Court’s injunction,” attorneys for the National Treasury Employees Union wrote Sunday. “Parties may not simply declare that an injunction no longer applies.” The CFPB this monthalertedthe U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia that it “anticipates exhausting its currently available funds in early 2026.” At issue is the definition of “combined earnings.” The Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel sent a memo to CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought on Nov. 7, asserting that it interprets earnings – from which the Federal Reserve derives the CFPB’s operating budget – as profit rather than revenue. By that math, the Fed has operated at a loss since 2022. NTEU attorneys asserted Sunday that the Fed earns “billions of dollars a year – from interest on loans and securities, and fees assessed” on banks. But because the Fed has raised interest rates since 2022, its combined interest expenses have exceeded combined earnings. The plaintiffs cite congressional testimony from Fed Chair Jerome Powell, who told lawmakers the central bank examined that balance “very carefully” and concluded the law is “very clear” that the Fed must fund the CFPB even when its expenses exceed its earnings. Further, NTEU attorneys said, the OLC memo “admits, nobody – not any court, not the Fed, and not the CFPB – has ever interpreted” combined earnings as it suggested this month. “Both the Fed and the CFPB (until Vought needed a mechanism to circumvent this Court’s injunction) have consistently understood ‘combined earnings’ to mean, simply, everything the Fed earns,” NTEU attorneys wrote. The OLC’s interpretation relies on “technical definitions from corporate accounting,” NTEU attorneys wrote. “But the Fed is not a private corporation. It sets monetary policy for the United States. … The only reason to adopt its reading of ‘combined earnings’ is to shut down the CFPB.” Vought, in an appearance last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show,” indeed said of the CFPB: “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within thenext two, three months.” The bureau last week indicated it istransferring all of its active litigationto the DOJ. By the OLC’s logic, NTEU attorneys wrote, Congress would have passed a Dodd-Frank Act “that forces the Federal Reserve Board to choose between increasing interest rates to combat inflation and funding the CFPB.” “Fortunately, that is not the law that Congress wrote,” the attorneys asserted, blasting the CFPB for not choosing another path. “Rather than asking this Court to modify its injunction (which would require them to demonstrate that it should), the defendants have chosen to just ‘inform’ the Court that they ‘do not understand’ the injunction to bind them once the CFPB runs out of money – even if that’s because they decided not to ask the Fed for funding,” NTEU attorneys wrote. Outside of the courtroom, the CFPB on Friday issued what it termed a “humility pledge” meant to be read aloud by bank examiners to banks before exams. The statement drills down on the bureau’snarrowing of focustoward consumer threats that harm service members, veterans and their families and reiterates that the bureau will “avoid, where possible, duplication of supervision, where States or other regulators are already doing that job.” The bureau pledges shorter examination times – reduced from eight weeks to a period “commensurate with the defined scope of exams.” “No longer will the Bureau ask for expansive data sets or other information which may seem unrelated to the exam or include information inconsistent with Bureau priorities,” the pledge reads. “Any follow-up requests by examiners will first be discussed with an entity and will be tailored to the scope of the exam and the information already received from the entity.” The CFPB states its goal as “[to] work collaboratively with the entities to review entities’ processes for compliance and/or remedy existing problems,” emphasizing self-reporting and encouraging banks to resolve issues with the CFPB’s supervision unit, rather than enforcement. That may lend credence to a narrative, from an all-hands meeting of enforcement staff, in which the bureau’s acting enforcement chief said all 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation at the end of the year. Curiously, perhaps, the pledge encourages banks, if they find their exam experience to be “inconsistent with these principles,” to reach out via email to a designated CFPB supervisory official or the bureau’s chief legal officer. In apost Monday on the NTEU’s website, union member Alexis Goldstein asked, “Why is Russell Vought showing the world his weird, creepy pledge of allegiance to big corporations?” Another union member, Doug Wilson, notes a passage in the pledge in which the bureau asserts that examiners will be “encouraged and incentivized to complete the work promptly and under budget.” “This memo doesn't add up,” Wilson wrote. “Vought’s stopped all supervision exams in 2025, refuses to fund CFPB and says he’s shutting us down by 2026. So how will we supervise banks in 2026 if CFPB is closed? How can bank exams be ‘under budget’ if there is no budget?” In an emailed press release to accompany the humility pledge, the CFPB characterized the bureau’s Biden-era supervision efforts as “thuggery,” calling out ex-supervision chief LoreleiSalas as “a former [Democratic donor George] Soros activist who wasput on leave in February 2025.” Further, bureau leadership labeled the pre-Trump supervision unit as “a weaponized arm of the CFPB.” In aLinkedIn post, Allison Preiss, who until February served as senior adviser to the CFPB director, said the humility pledge “might be better characterized as a humiliation pledge.” “The notion that federal employees should genuflect, trembling, before a Wells Fargo or Bank of America, is some of the most ridiculous nonsense I've read all week,” she wrote. In anotherLinkedIn post, Tyler Creighton, counsel at the CFPB, took issue with the idea that the bureau is calling out examiners’ past conduct. “Supervision's workers have always conducted examinations professionally, efficiently, conscientiously, and with a focus on remedying consumer harm,” he wrote. “We will continue to do so, just as soon as Donald Trump and Russell Vought end the nearly 10-month suspension of examinations and let us get back to work for the American people.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-humility-pledge-supervision-enforcement-bank-examiners-fed-funding-refuse-vought-court/806314/,,
Stripe faces bank charter pushback,"A national trust banking charter would let the digital payments giant Stripe offer banking services while sidestepping certain regulations, an advocacy organization opposingthe payment provider's charter applicationargued in a letter to the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency this month. The National Community Reinvestment Coalition alsosaid in the letterthat the charter would give Stripe legitimacy that it does not deserve, pointing to the fintech’s history of legal trouble. Stripe, whichacquired a stablecoin infrastructure companycalled Bridge this year, proposes to name the bank Bridge National Trust. “The OCC must reject Stripe’s application for a national trust bank charter due to serious concerns regarding Stripe’s disregard for enforcement, governance, compliance, and consumer protection laws,” according to the Nov. 13 letter, which is addressed to Sebastian Astrada, the agency’s director for licensing of novel banks. The NCRC is a coalition of hundreds of U.S. community-based organizations which run the gamut from faith-based nonprofits to social justice advocates. The organization posted the letter on its website last week. Bridgeapplied for the charter in October. The charter would give Bridge and its parent company the right to provide custody, stablecoin issuance, and management of stablecoin reserves within a federal framework, rather than through state-to-state money transmitter licenses. Spokespeople for Stripe did not respond to messages seeking comment about the NCRC’s letter. If the charter is approved, Bridge would form the Bridge National Trust Bank, to be headquartered in New York City, according tothe Oct. 14 application. CEO Patrick Collison co-founded Stripe along with his brother John Collison, who is president of the business. “We’ve long believed stablecoins will be a core, regulated building block,” Bridge co-founder Zach Abrams wroteon the social media platform Xlast month. “This regulatory infrastructure will enable us to tokenize trillions of dollars and make this future possible.” The crypto firmsCircle,Paxos,RippleandCoinbasehave also applied for charters through the OCC, although none of those applications has been approved yet. With the trust, Stripe could also facilitate payments without supervision from the Federal Reserve, the NCRC said in its letter. “Granting these firms limited purpose trust charters would blur the statutory boundaries of what constitutes a bank, undermine the credibility of the national charter, and heighten systemic risk by allowing them to operate under a lighter regulatory regime,” the group wrote. The coalition also outlines some of the lawsuits and legal action taken against Stripe. In 2020, for example, the Massachusetts attorney general found Stripe had facilitated payments for a fraudulent cryptocurrency operation due to subpar risk monitoring and fraud prevention systems. The companyagreed to pay $120,000and improve its fraud control and employee training. The letter also lists several lawsuits against the company alleging, among other things, that Stripe failed to ensure customer privacy and protect customer data.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/stripe-faces-bank-charter-pushback/806315/,,
How the open banking rule skidded,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said this month it cannot draw funding to continue operations when its current funds lapse, presenting the agency a number of challenges in formulating an open banking rule quickly. The CFPBtold a federal courtNov. 11 that the Justice Department had concluded that the bureau cannot “lawfully draw funds” from the Federal Reserve System – which Congress designated as its funding source – and that the agency has funds to operate until year’s end. The bureau’s notice did not specify what would happen then, although the CFPB’s acting director, Russ Vought, has assailed the agency in the past and spoke publicly in October about itsclosure within months. The bureau has been working on a new open banking rule since July, when it told a federal court it would “substantially”revise the ruleand was granted a litigation stay of a lawsuitfiled last yearby banking trade groups. The CFPB did not respond to an email Monday seeking comment on the rule. Last week, the bureau notified employees that it wouldtransfer its litigation workto the DOJ and planned additional furloughs at year’s end. In its motion for a stay, the bureau told U.S. District Judge Danny Reeves it planned “an accelerated rulemaking process” to address what it considered to be deficiencies with the prior rule, enacted under the Biden administration. But any proposed rule with significant changes – such as allowing financial institutions to charge fees for access to customers’ data – would also require the bureau to assess the impacts to small businesses under the federal Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act, attorneys noted. At that point, a public comment period on the proposed rule – typically 30 to 90 days – would begin. The CFPB would then consider those comments and issue a final rule. However, the bureau is considering skipping some parts of the rulemaking process to issue a rule by year’s end, potentially including a public comment period on its proposed rule,Bloomberg Law reportedThursday, citing multiple people familiar with the matter. “Given the polarized view of these rules by the banking and FinTech sectors, if either constituency objects to the substance of the CFPB’s revisions, additional litigation could ensue,” an attorney with law firm McGlinchey Stafford, Adam Maarec, wrote in a Septemberalertabout the process. “An ‘accelerated rulemaking’ still takes a long time,” added Maarec, who advises fintechs and banks. The prior rule took CFPB staff four years from the rulemaking notice to a final rule, he noted, adding “the scope of issues here seems significantly narrower.” Banking groups that sued the bureau last year leaned heavily on the Administrative Procedure Act for their complaint, arguing that the agency had overstepped its authority to impose “a complicated, costly, and fundamentally insecure mandatory data-sharing framework” that did not allow banks to recover their costs. Last month, Reeves issued apreliminary injunctionpreventing the bureau from enforcing its rule, pending the revised rule the CFPB is formulating. A spokesperson for the Bank Policy Institute said Monday the organization understands that the bureau’s rulemaking process is moving forward but declined to comment further, directing other queries to the agency. The Financial Data and Technology Association, which counts data aggregators Plaid and Yodlee as members, said it continues to oppose any effort allowing banks to impose fees for customer data. Both Plaid and Yodlee have announced agreements with the largest U.S. bank, JPMorgan Chase, in the past two months that include new fees for data access. The Dodd-Frank Act does not permit fees, which are “a competitive toll on consumers simply for exercising their right to access and share their own financial information,” FDATA Executive Director Steve Boms said Monday in an emailed statement. “If banks are given the green light to impose those fees in a new rule, it would fundamentally shift control of financial data away from consumers and toward already powerful incumbents.” A spokesperson for the Financial Technology Association declined to comment Friday on the CFPB’s future or rule process, as did the American Fintech Council on Monday. Vought, who also leads the Office of Management and Budget, has been trying todramatically downsizethe CFPB’s workforce and mission since he was appointed acting director in February. “We don’t have anyone working there except our Republican appointees and a few career [employees] that are doing statutory responsibilities while weclose down the agency,” Vought said last month on “The Charlie Kirk Show.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months.” Conservative lawmakers and interest groups have targeted the bureau since Congress formed it 15 years ago as part of the Dodd-Frank Act. “The CFPB is a highly politicized, damaging, and utterly unaccountable federal agency. It is unconstitutional,” the conservative Heritage Foundation wrote in its “Project 2025Mandate for Leadership” document, in a chapter written by Robert Bowes, ahousing department officialin the first Trump administration and a former Chase Manhattan banking executive. “The next conservative President should order the immediate dissolution of the agency — pull down its prior rules, regulations and guidance, return its staff to their prior agencies and its building to the General Services Administration.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-open-banking-rule-skidded-fintechs-banks-vought-court/806436/,,
Ex-Truist employee sentenced in ‘complex’ check-cashing scheme,"A former Truist branch employee is one of eight Georgia residents sentenced in a counterfeit check-cashing scheme that involved stolen check information, the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Middle District of Georgiasaid Wednesday. The “complex” check-cashing and kickback scheme ran from at least November 2021 to December 2022, prosecutors said. At the time, Mariarlene Brown, aka “Mati Mom,” 44, of Valdosta, worked at a Truist branch in that city. In conspiring with Brown and others to commit bank fraud, William Allen Roberts, 27, of Valdosta, unlawfully obtained check information from Vincent Galliard, 41, of Sumter, South Carolina. Galliard was a former U.S. Postal Service employee in South Carolina who sold checks he stole from the mail, prosecutors said. Roberts used the check information provided by Galliard to produce fraudulent checks. Six others involved in the scheme recruited people to open Truist bank accounts and then got those people to provide their new Truist debit card and account information to those behind the scheme, “with the understanding that they would be paid for doing so,” prosecutors said. That group of co-conspirators included Frederick Pernell Green, 27; Thomas Christopher Mitchell, 31; Calvin Dewayne McKeithen, aka “Supa,” 26; Dewayne Rasheen Butler, aka “Guwapo,” 26; Tyler Khershad Jones, aka “LA Clippers,” 24; and Davontay Wiseman, aka “Vonn,” 28. Those six then passed the account information on to Roberts, who would write checks to those individuals in various amounts. Roberts, with Brown’s help, deposited checks into those accounts, and Brown made sure Roberts could withdraw cash from the accounts, according to prosecutors. Roberts paid Brown for her help in the scheme, as well as the co-conspirators and account holders, prosecutors said. Green, Roberts, Mitchell, McKeithen, Jones, Butler and Wiseman kept most of each check that was deposited, prosecutors said. Text messages the group members exchanged described the conspiracy, and investigators also discovered photos of debit cards, account numbers, fraudulent checks, cash obtained from the check deposits “and a custom-made diamond ring in the shape of the Truist logo worn by Green,” the U.S. Attorney’s Office said. Brown was sentenced to 33 months in prison, five years of supervised release and ordered to pay $390,475.84 in restitution to Truist on Oct. 9, after she pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud. Seven others – all except Galliard – also pleaded guilty to one count of conspiracy to commit bank fraud, were sentenced to prison time and ordered to pay Truist restitution in the same amount. Galliard pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit wire fraud in a South Carolina case and was sentenced to serve 30 months in prison, along with five years of supervised release, prosecutors said. Galliard was ordered to pay $149,692.14 in restitution divided among The Citizens Bank, First Citizens Bank, South Atlantic Bank, TD Bank, The Conway National Bank and Bank of America, according toa court filing. “Individuals who participate in check-cashing and kickback schemes will face imprisonment and other penalties,” U.S. Attorney Will Keyes said in the press release. “Investigators from the Secret Service and the Lowndes County Sheriff’s Office worked to unravel this criminal network, ultimately preventing further theft and helping us ensure accountability for the defendants.” Bank regulators seek to bolster their efforts to address check fraud, which has grown “substantially” in the past several years, Michelle Bowman, the Federal Reserve’s vice chair for supervision,said in June. Although check use has dropped, check fraud hasn’t diminished in tandem. “Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of real or attempted check fraud transactions grew nearly fourfold, even as the number of checks paid fell by more than 18 percent from 2018 to 2021,”the Federal Reserve Bank of Atlantareported this year.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ex-truist-employee-sentenced-check-cashing-scheme/806169/,,
Citi CFO Mark Mason to step down in March,"Citi CFO Mark Mason, arguably the highest-profile Black executive at a U.S.-based global systemically important financial institution, will step down from his role in early March, the bankannounced Thursday. At that point, Gonzalo Luchetti, now the bank’s head of U.S. personal banking, will become CFO. Mason, meanwhile, will transition to executive vice chair and senior executive adviser to Citi CEO Jane Fraser, but he intends to pursue leadership opportunities outside the bank by the end of 2026, according to the announcement. In his adviser role, Mason will help Citi prepare for its investor day May 7 and give guidance on the bank’s strategic initiatives. Mason has been a key figure in Citi’stwo-year reorganization, in which the bank set out to simplify its structure,trim its headcount by 20,000employees by 2026, and embrace tech modernization meant to free it fromtwo 2020 consent orders. Citi launched further reorganization Thursday, saying it would integrate its retail bank into its wealth business. The move arguably hands more responsibility to wealth chief Andy Sieg. The bank’s U.S. Everyday Banking, Citi Priority, Citigold and Citigold Private Client labels will be consolidated into a single group led by Kate Luft. Luft, who has served as head of U.S. retail bankingsince April, will add “and Citigold” to her title and report to Sieg. With the move, “U.S. Personal Banking” will no longer be one of Citi’s five core businesses, the company said. But it will be replaced by “U.S. Consumer Cards,” which will combine the bank’s branded cards and retail services businesses under Pam Habner. Habner, who has served as Citi’s head of branded cards and lendingsince 2020, will join the bank’s executive management team and report directly to Fraser. “This evolution of our leadership team and structure is well timed as it puts in place our next generation of leaders ahead of our upcoming Investor Day, when we will lay out our plans to further grow our returns,” Fraser said Thursday in a statement. “We are ending the year with momentum and confidence.” Mason’s upcoming transition comes less than a month after Citi threw added support behind Fraser,naming her chairand giving her a $25 million equity award meant to keep her in place for years to come. Fraser on Thursday called Mason “an invaluable partner” who “models integrity, drive and commitment no matter the circumstances, and has always put the firm first.” “Mark has proven himself to be a leader for all seasons, having helped Citi navigate some of our most challenging times and being a driving force behind the results we are now seeing in our performance and our Transformation,” Fraser said, citing the capitalized term the bank gives its tech modernization. Mason joined Citi in 2001 and has been CFO since 2019 – but between those benchmarks has served as CEO of Citi’s private bank, CEO of Citi Holdings, and CFO of the bank’s Institutional Clients Group, according to hisLinkedIn profile. “Serving as CFO for the last seven years and contributing to a leadership team that is redefining expectations for Citi stands as one of the most demanding and fulfilling chapters of my career,” Mason said in a statement Thursday. “I know that Gonzalo will work tirelessly with the strong team we’ve built across Finance to further Citi’s momentum, and I am fully committed to his smooth transition into the new role.” Scott Siefers, a managing director and senior research analyst for Piper Sandler, called Mason’s departure “an unfortunate loss” for Citi. “Thankfully, he will be succeeded by an insider with deep experience,” Siefers wrote in a note seen by Banking Dive. Luchetti joined Citi in 2006 and has served, among other roles, as consumer banking chief for Asia, Europe, the Middle East and Africa, and as global head of wealth management and insurance, according to hisLinkedIn profile. He became head of U.S. personal banking in 2021 and on Thursday earned plaudits from Fraser for expanding his segment’s return on tangible common equity to 14.5% for 2025’s third quarter. “I knew exactly what we needed in our next CFO to build on Mark’s successful tenure,” Fraser said. “In addition to the table-stakes requirement of superb financial acumen, it must be someone who is strategically minded, data-driven, analytical, and an excellent operator. … Gonzalo is that person.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/citi-mark-mason-cfo-step-down-march-gonzalo-luchetti-fraser-sieg-luft-habner/806137/,,
Wells Fargo taps Saul Van Beurden to scale AI,"Saul Van Beurden, chief executive of Wells Fargo consumer and small business banking,has been tappedto scale artificial intelligence at the bank, the lender said Thursday. Additionally, the bank’s CEO for consumer lending, Kleber Santos, will take on added responsibilities as co-CEO of consumer lending and banking as Wells formally combines the businesses, allowing Van Beurden to focus more on AI. “Generative and agentic AI will reshape competitive dynamics across every industry, and we are embracing these tools as we have embraced robotic process automation and machine learning for years,” Wells CEO Charlie Scharf said in a prepared statement. In August, Wells gave branch bankers, investment bankers, customer relations and corporate teamsaccess to AI agents and toolsfrom Google Cloud. The tools help employees sort through massive loads of documentation and provide real-time market insights, among other things. Wells is among banks in a near-ubiquitous industry pushtoward AI-fueled efficiencies. Wells has trained some 90,000 employees on AI this year, deployed AI tools to many others and is now broadening its uses, Scharf said. “Our employees and customers have powerful models in their hands. They expect the same at work,” Van Beurden toldForbesthis month on AI. “GenAI helps remove simple repetitive tasks, builds workflows and frees people to do higher-value work. We are scratching the surface.” The key is to deploy AI in ways that “enhance human performance rather than replace it,” he told Forbes. In his enhanced role, Van Beurden will help leaders in Wells’ businesses oversee transformation in their own segments, Scharf said in a prepared statement. “Success will be driven by business heads embracing these new technologies and rethinking their own operating models using generative and agentic AI solutions,” Scharf said. The advances in AI, he added, “have given us a once in a lifetime opportunity to transform how we work and we are excited by what we can deliver for our employees, customers and communities.” Van Beurden joined Wells in2019 from JPMorgan Chase, where he was chief information officer of consumer and community banking. The San Francisco-based bankelevated him in 2023from head of technology to CEO of consumer and small-business banking.

CFPB is transferring its cases to DOJ,"The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau is transferring all of its active litigation to the Justice Department, according to separate statements Thursday from Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, and the workers union representing the agency. Further, Mike Salemi, the CFPB’s acting enforcement chief, said at an all-hands meeting Thursday that, as he understood it, all bureau employees would be furloughed at the end of the year,Government Executivereported, citing people familiar with the matter. Salemi hedged, saying he was not privy to all of the plans, but that the information came from an associate general counsel at the Office of Management and Budget who also serves as a senior legal adviser at the CFPB. The timeline, if true, would dovetail with a projection CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought made in a podcast appearance last month, when he said the only employees left at the bureau were “our Republican appointees and a few career [staff] that are doing statutory responsibilities while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the nexttwo, three months,” Vought said. Further, DOJ attorneys filed paperwork last week with the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, indicating the CFPB “anticipates exhaustingits currently available funds in early 2026.” The filing was meant to flag a “potential lapse in appropriations” to pay the bureau’s operating expenses. The court this year granted apreliminary injunctionpreventing the CFPB from firing the vast majority of its staff. Included in the filing was a memo the DOJ’s Office of Legal Counsel sent Vought, asserting that the bureau may not legally request funds at this time from the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. Salemi on Thursday said the 170 employees in his division were slated for an unpaid leave designation, according to Government Executive. A few top officials may have the opportunity to work for DOJ,American Bankerreported, citing people who were part of the all-hands call. Salemi noted that the DOJ stood up an enforcement and affirmative litigation unit within its Civil Division in September. Salemi told CFPB staff he assumed the agency’s work would be routed there beginning in 2026, according to Government Executive. Cat Farman, president of the National Treasury Employees Union 335, which represents CFPB employees, said Vought has “no legal authority” to transfer the bureau’s cases to the DOJ. “This is Russ Vought’s latest illegal power grab in his ongoing plan to shut down the CFPB,” Farman said in a statement on theNTEU’s website. However, the Dodd-Frank Act indicates the DOJ has the authority to handle cases where no agency is designated to do so by law,Bloomberg Lawreported. Before the CFPB was established in 2011, the DOJ took cases under the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act because no other agency had the power. The CFPB is still litigating 13 cases, Farman said, though Vought this year has dismissed 22 enforcement actions brought by the bureau under previous administrations. “CFPB attorneys are afraid DOJ will dismiss [the remaining] cases,” Farman said. The DOJ declined to comment. The CFPB didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. However, Warren, the senator credited as the architect of the bureau, appeared to hold tight to her suspicions. “Donald Trump and Russ Vought are racing to shut down the CFPB while their lawyers tell the courts the opposite,”Warren wrotein a statement Thursday. “Nobody is fooled about the Trump-Vought end game, and the courts must uphold the law.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-transfer-litigation-doj-enforcement-furloughs-salemi-vought/806193/,,
"TD illegally targeted, fired Chinese-heritage employees: lawsuit","Five former TD Bank employees of Chinese heritage say the bank illegally fired them in the wake of TD’s fentanyl-tied money laundering scandal,court documents show. Plaintiffs Andrew Wong, Ka Po Wong, Anne Louie, April Ng and Millie Su allege that TD “intentionally targeted and disproportionately impacted the bank’s Chinese and Chinese American employees” to placate investigators as they probed the lender’santi-money laundering control issues, and to “give the appearance of robust AML procedures.” The bank’s “robust enforcement” went “far beyond the normal scope” in investigating the employees’ personal transaction histories, particularly cash exchanges that moved through their bank accounts, the plaintiffs said. Chinese families traditionally borrow money from family and friends, rather than banks, and it’s common for family members to gift funds for large purchases, such as a house, plaintiffs said, citing a “financial culture [that] is prevalent in the Chinese diaspora, including the Chinese-American community.” The investigators did not take that into account, the plaintiffs asserted. In one instance, investigators pressed Ng on a $500 transaction in new bills meant as a gift during Chinese New Year, a custom. In another, investigators questioned Su about $15,000 in cash she received from family members. The funds, intended as a house down payment gift to a family associate, were deposited into Su’s account. She added $5,000 from her account, and wrote the associate a $20,000 check. “The targeted Chinese and Chinese American employees provided proof that transactions questioned by TD were legitimate, yet each still suffered the most severe adverse employment action possible. They were terminated,” plaintiffs allege. “More callously, the terminated Chinese and Chinese American were demarketed from TD Bank. TD closed their personal and business accounts, and, upon information and belief, barred them from banking with TD in the future.” Prior to the fentanyl-tied AML investigation, TD “leveraged the national origin of its Chinese and Chinese American employees to foster trust in the Chinese community and build their business,” plaintiffs said. During the investigation, however, TD’s Chinese and Chinese American employees “were then targeted by the bank because of their ethnicity and national origin. They were punished for crimes committed by other Chinese individuals — crimes they were not involved in by individuals they did not know.” “Their Chinese heritage, once used by TD Bank to garner trust in the Chinese community, now became a target for TD,” plaintiffs said. Due to TD’s investigations of its Chinese and Chinese American employees in the New York City’s Chinatown branches alone, at least 22 employees were terminated or subject to adverse employment actions, the lawsuit asserted. All but one of the terminated employees were of Chinese origin. At least one employee was terminated for a transaction with a Chinese American employee, according to court documents. Plaintiffs seek reinstatement at their respective jobs, back pay and emotional damages sustained as a result of TD’s conduct. A TD spokesperson told Banking Dive that the bank has no comment, given that the litigation is pending. Arthur Schwartz, an attorney for the plaintiffs, did not respond to a request for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/td-illegally-targeted-fired-chinese-heritage-employees-lawsuit/806066/,,

Capital One joins FedNow,"Capital One joined the Federal Reserve’s instant payments system FedNow this week, leaving Bank of America and Truist among the major U.S. financial institutions not participating in that real-time ecosystem. Capital One started its FedNow participation Tuesday, a spokesperson for the bank said by email. “Financial Institutions of all sizes are rapidly enabling instant payments for their accountholders,” U.S. Faster Payments Council CEO Reed Luhtanen said by email, when asked for comment on how the system is developing. “The ability to offer instant money movement is becoming table stakes in our 21st century economy, and financial institutions that don’t have a faster payments strategy need to develop one, and fast.” A spokesperson for Bank of America didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson confirmed late last month that the bank had not yet joined FedNow. FedNow has attracted all but two of theeight biggest U.S. retail banks, according to a list of participants on theFederal Reserve’s FedNow website. The service allows for the transfer of payments between banks in seconds or minutes, as opposed to some alternatives that take days. While about 1,550 U.S. financial institutions have joined the FedNow system since itlaunched in July 2023, there are thousands that have not, despite the central bank’s efforts to attract smaller banks as well. In all, there are about 9,000 U.S. financial institutions, including large banks, smaller regional and community banks, and credit unions. (Only U.S. financial institutions are allowed to connect to the FedNow system.) Nonetheless, the large banks are the most active in the payments sphere. The 50 biggest banks operating in the U.S. account for more than 90% of payment originations on the major clearing systems operated by The Clearing House andNacha, based on those organizations’ statistics. To smooth the way to joining the system, the Fed is trying to make it as easy as possible. Currently, the “record” time period for onboarding a bank — from signing a contract with the central bank to offering services — is seven days, FedNow Chief Executive Nick Stanescusaid in a video poston FedNow’s website Tuesday. He noted there are also 41 certified service providers that aid in bringing bank clients to the system. To boost transaction volume, FedNow has been gradually increasing the maximum amount that can be sent over the system.

Lloyds to buy UK fintech Curve,"London-based Lloyds Bank will buy theU.K. fintech Curve, the bankannounced Wednesday. Lloyds did not disclose the price point for the deal, which is expected to close in the first half of 2026. But the acquisition lends credence to aSky Newsreport from last week, indicating the bank would pay £120 million for the digital wallet provider. That’s less than half the £250 million in funding Curve is said to have raised since its founding in 2015. And it’s far below the valuation CEO Shachar Bialick had targeted for the company. “In ten years’ time we are going to be IPO-ed … and hopefully worth around $50 billion to $60 billion,” Bialick, a former Israeli special forces soldier, toldThe Times of Londonin 2019, using the acronym for initial public offering. In a circular to investors last week, Curve said it “share[s] the disappointment some of you may have in this outcome.” “We recognize that the value of this transaction falls short of the ambitions we all held for Curve,” the company said in the note, seen by Sky News. “Yet, the board strongly believes this transaction represents the best available path forward for Curve's creditors and shareholders as a whole."" However, IDC Ventures, an investor that holds a 12% stake in Curve, said in a statement Friday it is ""deeply concerned about the conduct of Curve's management and board during the current sale process."" IDC alleged a small group of directors and investors at Curve “facilitated corporate decision-making to entrench control and override shareholder rights,” adding that “issues regarding [Curve’s] governance and ownership are disputed.” The investor sought toremove Curve's chairin September, but the effort failed. IDC has consistently opposed a sale to Lloyds since rumors of a potential transaction became public in July. The investor wrote “repeatedly” to Curve and its board, opposing the sale, “without receiving any meaningful response or engagement,” it asserted in September. IDC also said it wrote to Lloyds, but the bank did not respond. “It is a matter of real surprise to shareholders that Lloyds Banking Group, a leading UK institution, would contemplate proceeding with a transaction that IDC believes is not in the best interests of the company or its shareholders,” IDC wrote Friday, adding it “does not believe” a sale could be “implemented” without the investor’s support. Curve’s auditors earlier this year had warned of “material uncertainty” at the firm, according toCityAM. Financial figures published in March revealed the company had paused its plans to expand to the U.S. and, in 2023, cut about a third of its workforce, according totech.eu. Curve reported a pretax loss of £36 million in 2023, up from £69 million the year before. Bialick, when asked if Curve would be profitable in 2024, said the company’s “priority is sustainable expansion, and we anticipate reaching break-even in the near term.” Curve touts a digital wallet platform that brings all of a user’s cards and alternative payment sources into one place, while offering payment flexibility, real-time spend insights and no foreign exchange fees. In a statement onCurve’s blog Wednesday, Bialick said Curve’s “mission” has always been to “simplify and supercharge people’s finances.” “Joining forces with Lloyds Banking Group means we can now scale that vision faster, helping tens of millions more customers unlock smarter payments, and empower greater financial accessibility,” he said. Curve, on its own, counts 6 million customers. Lloyds, by comparison, reaches 28 million. The bank announced in January it planned toclose 136 branchesin the U.K. as customers rely more heavily on digital banking. Buying a digital wallet platform, presumably, would dovetail with that vision. “Building on the innovative changes we’ve made to our app recently, integrating Curve’s cutting-edge technology and digital wallet capabilities will deliver a next-generation digital banking experience for our customers as we help them to take control of their finances in a simple and convenient way,” Jas Singh, CEO of consumer relationships at Lloyds, said in a release Wednesday. Lloyds said Wednesday the transaction is not expected to have a material impact on the bank, or to affect full-year guidance for 2025 or 2026.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/lloyds-bank-uk-acquire-fintech-curve-digital-wallet-120-million-idc-investor-concern/806065/,,
NY AG’s office scrutinizes SoLo Funds,"Fintech lender SoLo Funds is engaged with the New York attorney general’s office related to usury concerns, an executive said this week. Denzel Singletary, head of government affairs and strategic partnerships at the company, said SoLo Funds was served a subpoena this year by state AG Letitia James’ office. “We're in negotiations with them now, figuring out … what common ground looks like,” Singletary said, speaking Monday at the Banking Transformation Summit in Charlotte, North Carolina, on the topic of fintechs and regulators working together. James’ office declined to comment Tuesday. After SoLo Funds was subpoenaed, “my job initially was to make sure New York knew that we were not working in a nefarious way,” Singletary said. He said he highlighted the fintech’s community platform and tried to dispel misconceptions customers are being charged exorbitant interest rates. SoLo Funds bills itself as a community finance platform. Its business model has drawn the attention of regulators in a handful of states who view its “tip” structure asa predatory lending practice. In recent years, SoLo hasreached agreements with regulatorsin California, Washington, D.C., Connecticut and Pennsylvania related toallegations borrowers were required to pay large “tips” to access loans through its platform. In May 2024,the Los Angeles-based fintech was suedby the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The bureau,then under the Biden administration, also took issue with SoLo’s “tip” structure, which it said obscured the total cost of loans. The CFPB also said SoLo, which marketed itself as a consumer-friendly alternative to pricier, short-term loans, hid from borrowers the option to forgo a tip, and offered loans to borrowers in states that require platforms to have a license. SoLo said it had long since changed some components of its display the CFPB called out in the lawsuit. In February, under the Trump administration, the CFPBdropped the lawsuitagainst SoLo Funds. Russ Vought, the CFPB’s acting director who also leads the OMB, said at the time that the bureau under former director Rohit Chopra “shockingly” tried to “destroy” SoLo, “which incurred millions in legal fees and had to lay off 30% of its workforce.” “It was wrong and we dismissed the case,” Vought said. Prior tojoining SoLo Funds in 2024, Singletary was the director of U.S. government affairs at investing fintech Robinhood. “When SoLo Funds reached out to me to come and work with them,” he said, “it was this opportunity of figuring out, how do I make this fintech work well with regulators? What can I do to strengthen this relationship with this particular fintech and regulators?” That task was made far more difficult when, two weeks after he joined SoLo Funds, the firm was sued by the CFPB. He called that “a very interesting intro into the company,” but said he wasn’t deterred in seeking to make sure the regulator and the fintech understood each other. Then came a “blessing” in the form of the presidential administration change in January, Singletary said. “It was an opportunity for us to state our case in front of a new body, really,” he said. In doing that, the fintech focused on its community of users. “What does this whole community look like? What is this application actually doing? Who is it actually helping?” he said. “The customers are always going to make it make sense for the regulators,” he said. “I highlighted the fact that even though there's misconceptions, that we were facing those and actually working through them.” SoLo Funds became the first company to have a lawsuit dismissed by the current CFPB, which has since dropped a number of lawsuits filed under the Biden administration. “I genuinely think that's because we highlighted the community,” Singletary said. “Bodies really matter” when it comes to cooperation between fintechs and regulators. As the CFPB has reversed course on a number of actions, James has been quick to pick up the mantle in New York. Her officesued Capital Oneover lost interest payments to consumers andsued Early Warningover alleged fraud at Zelle – and initiated both after the CFPB dropped similar lawsuits this year. James’ office has also filed lawsuits against earned wage access providersMoneyLion and DailyPay, alleging they made “illegal, high-interest loans” to thousands of workers. Travis Holoway and Rodney Williams, the founders of SoLo Funds, soughtto establish an alternative to costly payday lenders, Singletary said. They“were two college-educated men who had made it, and their friends and family were consistently asking them for loans,” Singletary said. SoLo Funds, which launched in 2018, offers checking accounts and debit cards, and through its loan marketplace, members can request loans that other users can fund. The fintech – which taps Bangor Savings Bank for banking services – has about 2 million customers and 1.8 million deposit accounts, and has facilitated about $1 billion in transactions, Singletary said.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/ny-ag-james-solo-funds-tips-cfpb-fintech-regulators/806024/,,
Senators back open banking rule,"Several Senate Democrats on Thursday called on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to keep pursuing open banking rules that give consumers the ability to easily shift their personal data from one financial institution to another. Sens. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Ron Wyden of Oregon and Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut pressed CFPB Acting Director Russ Vought in a letter seen by Payments Dive to continue the federal agency’s work in writing a rule under the Dodd-Frank Act that would further such consumer rights, without fees. The agency issued such a rule last year during the Biden administration, but bank trade groups sued over the regulation and it has been tied up in court. Under Vought’s leadership, the agency stopped backing the Biden-era rule in the litigation, which a judge has stayed, pending the agency’s decision to rewrite the rule. At the same time, Vought is aggressively shrinking the agency and threatening to shutter it, leaving the rule’s future in doubt. “We are concerned that the Trump CFPB’s policymaking seems to be more driven by the seesawing interests of big banks and other industry groups than with protecting consumers’ rights to their own data, as mandated by law,” the senators wrote in their letter. The senators alsoissued a press releaseThursday, insisting Vought reinstate the priorPersonal Financial Data Rights rule. “In the absence of the rule, big banks have demonstrated that they intend to charge exorbitant fees for this data to choke off competition and concentrate this data in the hands of a few large incumbents,” the senators wrote. The senators also contended that banks should not be allowed to charge for access to the data, saying it would be a violation of the law. “Large financial institutions have a monopoly over large swaths of consumer data and thus have the potential to drive out competitors and start ups in the data sharing market,” the letter said. The senators specifically called out JPMorgan Chase, the largest U.S. bank, for imposing fees this year on third-party data aggregators, including the fintech Plaid. That bank’s fees were “at rates high enough to paralyze the market,” the letter said, noting that PayPal’s peer-to-peer payment tool Venmo and neobank Chime use Plaid to connect users’ bank accounts to their apps. JPMorgan Chase was set to impose an estimated $300 million in new fees annually on Plaid, the senators said, citing an article from Forbes, before the companies reached an agreement in September on terms that weren’t disclosed. JPMorgan Chase’s initial fee structure “indicates where the market may be moving absent the CFPB’s rule,” the letter said. A second data aggregator, Yodlee, this month said it had reached anupdated agreementwith JPMorgan Chase over access fees. The senators argued that “it is critical that any revisions the CFPB makes to the Personal Financial Data Rights rule recognize the importance of consumers being able to exercise their rights, which includes deciding how and by whom their data is used.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/open-banking-cfpb-warren-wyden-blumenthal-vought-jpmorgan-plaid-chime-venmo-yodlee/806190/,,
Florida credit union to buy Georgia bank,"Jacksonville, Florida-based Community First Credit Union of Florida will buy Waycross, Georgia-based First Southern Bank, creating a $3.3 billion-asset institution, thecredit union announced Tuesday. The deal, which would extend the credit union’s footprint into southeast Georgia and elsewhere into Florida, is thesecond CU-bank tie-up announced this week,after El Paso, Texas-based GECU proposed buying Roswell, New Mexico-based Bank of the Southwest on Monday. “While we love the growth opportunities that come with the transaction, this acquisition is founded on a unified vision between Community First and First Southern Bank,” Sam Inman, CEO of Community First, said in a prepared statement. “Both institutions emphasize a community-oriented and relationship-based approach, maintaining a culture that respects individuals and prioritizes service excellence.” Both institutions are storied: Community First is 90 years old. First Southern is 118 years old. The transaction, which has been unanimously approved by the boards of directors of both institutions, is expected to close in the second or third quarter of 2026. After that, First Southern’s holding company will liquidate, dissolve and distribute any remaining assets to its stockholders. The new Community First will count roughly $2.5 billion in loans and $2.9 billion in deposits across 31 branches. “First Southern Bank customers will continue to see their trusted familiar banker at each location,” said First Southern CEO Daniel Hager in a prepared statement. “The newly combined institution will have the ability to offer highly personalized financial services, which will enable us the financial capabilities to support further expansion.” Community First plans to retain all First Southern employees, stretching its headcount to 530. “Combining will expand services and strengthen community impact,” Community First said in a Q&A on its website. Tie-ups between credit unions and banks are not without challengers.Independent Community Bankers of America CEO Rebeca Romero Rainey released a statement Tuesday calling for policymakers “to address the harmful impact these deals have on local communities.” CitingICBA data, Rainey said the deals harm “small businesses and local communities while community banks outperform credit unions in high-poverty areas.” She called for Congress to eliminate the federal tax exemption for credit unions with more than $1 billion in assets. More than 80% of deals since 2010 have involved credit unions of that size, ICBA found. Four in 10 deals have involved a credit union headquartered in a different state than the acquired bank. Small Business Administration lending fell almost 80% at community banks that were acquired by credit unions, according to ICBA, and the amount loaned per approved mortgage application at the institutions decreased 61%. Michael Bell, a partner at Honigman who often architects such deals – including this one – told Banking Dive that ICBA’s statements are without “substance.” “The ICBA equates size to evil for some reason,” he said. “I ask the ICBA, is a $1 billion community bank still a community bank? Should all community banks larger than $1 billion give up the many tax subsidies enjoyed by community banks?”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/florida-credit-union-buy-georgia-bank/805897/,,
White House nominates Vought aide to lead CFPB,"Additionally, Geof Gradler was named deputy director of the CFPB. He’s a former lobbyist who joined the bureau about four months ago, according tohis LinkedIn profile. The CFPB spokesperson declined to comment on the fate of the agency, or whether the bureau intended to make a similar move in another 210 days. Vought said last monthon a podcast that onlyRepublican appointees and a few career employees remain “while we close down the agency.” “We want to put it out – and we will be successful probably within the next two, three months,” Vought said. Trump administration officials have tried repeatedly this yearto hobble or shutterthe agency but have, at times run into court-ordered roadblocks. The CFPB spokesperson said the hearing process likely will be a moot point for Levenbach. The Senate probably wouldn’t get around to it until next year, the spokesperson said, and with Vought not going anywhere, the formal process may not occur. Michael Emancipator, senior vice president and regulatory counsel at the Independent Community Bankers of America,noted on LinkedInWednesday that Levenbach’s nomination appears to be “merely a resetting of the clock” under the Federal Vacancies Reform Act. And McGuireWoods partner Jeff Ehrlich, a former deputy enforcement director at the CFPB, said the nomination is “likely a placeholder,” according toa LinkedIn post. The spokesperson pointed toa news releasethe bureau issued last week, in which the CFPB said itinformed the court inNTEU v. Voughtthat the Justice Department’s Office of Legal Counsel determined that the CFPBcan’t legally request fundsfrom the Federal Reserve under the Dodd-Frank Act. The CFPB “anticipates having sufficient funds to continue operations until at least December 31,” the release said.DOJ attorneys told the court that available funds are expected to run out in early 2026. Levenbach is also vice chair of theNational Capital Planning Commission, a panel that Voughtthreatened to involvein this summer’s dust-up over an over-budget renovation at the Federal Reserve. Levenbach served as chief of staff of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration during Trump’s first term. Later, he became a senior adviser with the White House National Economic Council and the White House Council on Environmental Quality, according tohis LinkedIn profile. Prior to those roles, he spent about a decade at OMB. “Donald Trump’s sending the Senate a new nominee to lead the CFPB looks like nothing more than a front for Russ Vought to stay on as Acting Director indefinitely as he tries to illegally close down the agency,” Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-MA, ranking member of the Senate Banking Committee, said in a Wednesday statement. “Instead of doing everything in their power to lower costs for Americans, Trump and Vought want to make it easier for giant corporations to scam families out of their money.” Consumer Bankers Association CEO Lindsey Johnson said Levenbach’s nomination “comes at a critical time for consumers and the financial services marketplace.” “America’s leading Main Street banks look forward to continuing to work with the Trump Administration on data-driven, pro-growth policies that will support hardworking Americans and drive the economy forward, while at the same time ensuring the Bureau fulfills its statutory mission and sticks to what Congress authorized it to do,” she said in a Wednesday statement. “This will not only help restore the trust and credibility of the CFPB, but will benefit consumers, industry, and the broader economy alike.”",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/cfpb-director-levenbach-vought-omb-trump/805913/,,
LevelField gets state approval to buy Chicago bank,"LevelField filed a fresh application to buy Burling inDecember 2024. In that paperwork, the Houston firm said it would pay roughly $70 million for the bank, which counts a single branch and $209.5 million in assets. The combined entity will be renamed LevelField Bank but maintain Burling’s community banking business. However, it will add a focus on deposit accounts, loans and custody services tailored to digital assets, including term loans and credit cards secured by bitcoin or Ether, according to the application. Burling's CEO, Michael Busch, will become president of LevelField Bank, Grant said. From the beginning, LevelField said it sought to become the first full-service chartered bank to offer traditional banking and digital asset services on one platform across the U.S. ""The idea is, once we have a customer, they don't have to go outside the bank perimeter for anything they want to do in digital assets,” Grant told American Banker. Grant said he expects acquisition to be finalized by the end of this year. Only Burling’s cannabis banking business will retain the Burling brand, LevelField said. To accommodate the anticipated round-the clock needs of its digital-asset user base, LevelField aims to hire roughly 100 employees in 2026 – mostly in customer service, Grant said. Once LevelField receives regulatory approval, it aims to raise $112.5 million, according to its December 2024 filing. That is meant to cover the acquisition of the bank, $20 million in growth capital and $17.5 million that LevelField will retain, the company said. In a release Monday, Grant thanked investors “for backing the patient, disciplined work it took to meet the necessary supervisory standards that protect consumers and businesses and make the U.S. the home of the world leading banking system."" As far as embracing crypto, Grant said the banking system can either ""live in denial or we can try to safely integrate it … in such a way that it works collaboratively and doesn't endanger the system."" “Financial services must be changed from the inside, and unlike other industries, outside disruptors barely move the needle,” Granttold Bloomberg.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/levelfield-acquire-burling-bank-illinois-regulator-approval-crypto-digital-asset/805947/,,
FDIC countersues Capital One over special assessment,"The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. accused Capital One of paying $99.4 million less than necessary to replenish the Deposit Insurance Fund following the 2023 failures of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank, according tocourt documents filed Monday. The FDIC’s lawsuit countered legal action takenin Septemberagainst the regulator by the bank, which alleged the FDICimposed an “outsized and improperly calculated” special assessment fee on Capital One. The FDIC inflated its assessment against Capital One by $149.2 million, the bank said in September. At issue is a $56 billion position between two Capital One subsidiaries which, according to Monday’s lawsuit, Capital One excluded in its reporting of uninsured deposits. Capital One said the agency “erroneously” included the position as uninsured deposits, inflating what the bank owed. The FDIC used funds from the DIF to protect uninsured depositors when banks fail. When SVB and Signature Bank were seized by the FDIC in March 2023, most of their deposits – 88% and 67%, respectively – were above the FDIC’s $250,000 threshold and “uninsured.” To recoup DIF funds later that year, the FDIC implemented a special assessment on the nation’s largest banks, including Capital One. The FDIC argued Monday that Capital One benefits from deposit insurance, and that the funds were “deposits held at the bank for which the subsidiary already received the benefit of FDIC deposit insurance.” ""There are no time machines when it comes to special assessments,” the FDIC said. Capital One and the FDIC did not immediately respond to requests for comment.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/fdic-countersues-capital-one-over-special-assessment/805937/,,
JPMorgan Chase enhancing due diligence for clients in the Amazon region,"The change itself does not come with any inherent restrictions on client activities or transactions in the region, but a JPMorgan spokesperson told ESG Dive on Wednesday that each activity and transaction will be considered “on a case-by-case basis, in line with [its] risk appetite and commercial interests.” “Managing risk is critical to the long-term success of our business,” the bank’s spokesperson said in emailed comments. “We added Amazon Biome as one example of a business location associated with clients and/or transactions we consider sensitive or in need of enhanced review, to facilitate a comprehensive understanding of the associated risks.” The RAISG geospatial definition, which JPMorgan will use to define the biome, “is widely recommended by Indigenous leaders and activists,” according to Stand.earth. Allison Fajans-Turner, a senior campaigner at the Rainforest Action Network — one of the environmental organizations backing the annual Banking on Climate Chaos reports — said requiring enhanced due diligence for activities in the Amazon biome is “the bare minimum that we should expect from other large backers of Amazon drilling.” “JPMorgan Chase has finally taken an essential — if long-overdue — step to confront its role as the largest financier of oil and gas extraction in the Amazon,” Fajans-Turner said in Stand.earth’s Nov. 13 release. After 30% of JPMorgan’s shareholders supported a proposal to require the bank to issue a report on its practices on Indigenous People's rights in the 2024 proxy season, JPMorgan reached an agreement with shareholders proposing a similar filing in the most recent proxy season. The United Church Fundwithdrew its proposal to the bankin April — afterJPMorgan submitted a no-action requeston the filing — once the bank agreed to add a disclosure stating “the company will consider free, prior and informed consent where risks are identified before proceeding with transactions that may have material implications for Indigenous Peoples.” “Promises on paper to respect Indigenous and human rights and screen clients operating in the Amazon biome fall far short of what’s needed: real financing exclusions applied to the Amazon and other fragile ecosystems and rigorous implementation of human rights protections for Indigenous peoples and all affected local communities,” Fajans-Turner said in the Nov. 13 release. In addition to the Arctic and the Amazon, JPMorgan requires a case-by-case enhanced review for coal mining and coal-fired power activities; clients whose “main business is the physical trading of conflict minerals,” cobalt or diamond trading; and hydropower, agricultural commodities or downstream agricultural commodity use in non-designated countries.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/jpmorgan-chase-enhancing-due-diligence-amazon-region-clients-standearth/806007/,,
Investor blasts Comerica over Fifth Third deal,"Activist investor HoldCo Asset Management on Monday probed Comerica’s $10.9 billion deal to be acquired by Fifth Third and threatened legal action against the bank if more information on the deal process isn’t released. Additionally, Birmingham, Alabama-based Regions was Comerica’s first suitor, before the Dallas-based bank struck a deal with Fifth Third,American Bankerreported Tuesday, citing unnamed sources. Spokespeople for Regions and Fifth Third declined to comment. A Comerica spokesperson didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. Fort Lauderdale, Florida-based HoldCoprodded Comerica to sell itselfto a larger bank in July,accusing the regional lender of making “disastrous decisions” and having “objectively poor performance.” HoldCo, whichowns about 2.04 million shares of Comerica stock,suggested PNC, Fifth Third or Huntington as possible buyers. In October, Fifth Third said it wasacquiring Comerica for $10.9 billionin stock. Earlier this month,a regulatory filingrevealed that the Cincinnati-based lender was not Comerica’s first suitor. The CEO of another bank, identified as Financial Institution A in the filing, proposed an all-stock transaction with $78 billion-asset Comerica in September. But Comerica’s board determined the terms “were not likely to be more attractive than the consideration that could be offered by another counterparty.” HoldCo’s65-page presentation issued Monday, which parsed recent regulatory filings, alleged a lack of board oversight in Comerica CEO Curt Farmer’s interactions with Fifth Third CEO Tim Spence and the absence of a competitive process in the Fifth Third deal, saying “this isn’t negotiation; it’s surrender.” HoldCo accused Comerica’s board of ignoring Financial Institution A’s proposals, a choice it called “indefensible,” and contended “had you engaged, we believe those ‘preliminary’ bids would have matured into definitive proposals — at likely materially higher levels.” HoldCo also critiqued Farmer’s “windfall” – he’s set to become a Fifth Third vice chair and make nearly $9 million annually, among other perks – and the deal’s “aggressive” breakup fee of $500 million. The acquisition is set to face a shareholder vote in January. HoldCo demanded a raft of details, calling on Comerica to “provide a more complete and transparent chronology of the events leading up to the Fifth Third transaction.” That includes when the board first discussed potential responses to shareholder pressure and when it authorized Comerica management to explore a merger, as well as information on the identity of Financial Institution A, the timing, substance and financial terms of its proposals, and whether Comerica or its advisers engaged with that bank. “The apparent absence of any follow-up engagement with a bidder who made an offer — combined with the lack of evidence that J.P. Morgan sought to create competition between bidders — suggests a process engineered to favor Fifth Third rather than one designed to maximize shareholder value,” the activist investor said. HoldCo also pressed for details on the decision to hire JPMorgan Chase as Comerica’s financial adviser, and seeks more specifics related to Farmer’s conversations with Spence. “The size and timing of Mr. Farmer’s compensation package strongly indicate a potential conflict of interest — namely, that Fifth Third effectively ‘overpaid’ the CEO to secure a lower purchase price for shareholders,” the activist said. If the bank doesn’t provide the requested detail, “we will have to consider seeking expedited relief in the Delaware Court of Chancery to obtain the disclosures we believe are warranted,” HoldCo said. The activist may also consider bringing fiduciary-duty claims in the Delaware court. In recent months, Regions executives have repeatedly expressed disinterest in acquiring a bank, instead eyeing the opportunity to snag customers and talentamid disruption caused by other M&Aactivity. Regions CFO David Turner reiterated those views this month at theBancAnalysts Association of Boston conference– which would have been after the bank reportedly proposed a deal with Comerica. “We're, I think, the only bank that hadn't done an acquisition since 2006,” Turner said Nov. 7. The bank had just finished its strategic plan, “and M&A is not part of that plan,” he said. “It's just not part of where we want to focus our time and attention. And we understand things can change, but that's just not where we are today,” Turner added. Still, one analyst noted some wonder whether the bank’s position may change. “With increased M&A activity in their Southeast backyard, there have been investors who wonder if [Regions management] would start to feel compelled to take part in the M&A wave, particularly since the company is profitable but has had challenges growing organically,” Truist Securities analyst Brian Finneran wrote in a Tuesday note.",https://www.bankingdive.com/news/holdco-activist-comerica-fifth-third-bank-deal-regions/805807/,,
